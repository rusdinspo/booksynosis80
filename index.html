The first is a translation of selections from the Diamond Sutra itself, an ancient text comprised of conversations between the Buddha and his close disciple Subhuti. Considered a central work by Buddhists throughout the world, the Diamond Sutra has been the focus of much interpretation over the centuries. In the second layer, Geshe Michael quotes from some of the best commentaries of the Tibetan tradition. In the main text, the third layer, he uses both sutra and commentary as a jumping-off point for presenting his own teaching.<br><br>Geshe Michael gives fresh insight into ancient wisdom by using examples from his own experience as one of the founders of the Andin International Diamond Corporation, which was started with capital of fifty thousand dollars and which today has annual sales in excess of one hundred million dollars. Much of the success of Andin has come from applying the business strategies presented in <b>The Diamond Cutter</b>. Geshe Michael's easy style and spiritual understanding make this work of timeless wisdom an invaluable source for those already familiar with, and those unfamiliar with, Tibetan Buddhism.</p><p>Other Buddhist books offer you a path to happiness, Geshe Michael Roach offers a path to wealth. Roach, who while being a monk helped build a $100 million business, demonstrates how ancient notions in <i>The Diamond Cutter</i> sutra can help you succeed, and if you're in business that means to make money, a lot of it. Drawing on lessons he learned in the diamond business and years in Buddhist monasteries, Roach shows how taking care of others is the ultimate path to taking care of oneself, even--especially--in business. As he puts it, you have to engage in "mental gardening," which means doing certain practical things that will form new habits that will create an ideal reality for you. If this sounds a little outrageous, his very precise instructions are down to earth and address numerous specific issues common to the business/management world. Through this practice, you will become a considerate, generous, introspective, creative person of immense integrity, and that will be the key to your wealth. At first this book comes off like a gimmick and the writing isn't without rough patches, but page by page, as Roach introduces you to the practical details and real-life examples, his arguments become more convincing. A cross between the Dalai Lama's ethics and Stephen Covey's <i>Seven Habits</i>, <i>The Diamond Cutter</i> will have you gardening a path to the bank. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><p>&#x201c;A Cross between the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s ethics and Stephen Covey&#x2019;s <i>Seven Habits</i>, <i>The Diamond Cutter</i> will have you gardening a path to the bank.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Amazon.com</i>, editorial review<br><br>&#x201c;Here is wise advice and counsel on an ethical and prosperous way of being in the workday world based on Tibetan Buddhist principles.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Spirituality and Health</i></p></p><h2>Time Management: Introduction to Franklin Systems</h2><p>Self Help Time Management.

Over the course of a season, games are, of course, won or lost, but for millions of devoted fans, the final result is almost incidental to the way the league's best players perform on - and off - the court. </p><p>This book is the indispensible companion to today's game - a roundball Rosetta Stone that hilariously decodes the trends and tendencies of this enormously popular game. The NBA of the moment is a league of hugely charismatic celebrities, crackling aesthetic intrigue, socio-political undercurrents, and raw humanity: every Kobe Bryant pump-fake or LeBron James dunk symbolizes the changing landscape of professional sports and holds within it a Shaq-sized load of meaning. Fans who know the sport recognize how much more there is to basketball than, well, basketball. <i>The Macro-Phenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac </i>is a brilliantly illustrated guide to this tumultuous and exciting landscape. It explains what each player--from Tim Duncan and Gilbert Arenas to Amare Stoudemire and Lamar Odom--reveals, through their play and conduct, about who they are and, more importantly, who the fans want them to be. </p><p>Like the game it celebrates, <i>The Macro-Phenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac</i> is simultaneously authentic and cerebral, funny and accessible, wholly original, and always entertaining.</p></p><p><p><b>Amazon Best of the Month, December 2008</b>: From its mouthful of a name, you might expect <i>The Macrophenomenal Pro Basketball Almanac</i> to be one of the new breed of fantasy-friendly stathead sports guides in the vein of the <i>Baseball Prospectus</i>. Or, from its blogger pedigree (via the popular FreeDarko.com), you might assume it's one of those quickie blog-into-book projects that repurposes new-media content into an old-media package. But it's neither--not even close. Bucking the data-crunching trend, the <i>Almanac</i>'s pseudonymous authors instead embrace the mythical side of pro sports, reminding us that the difference between, say, LeBron and AI lies not just in 0.2 ppg but in the rich drama of potential, style, and lore that each star represents. And the <i>Almanac</i> is no blog: it's every inch a book, freshly imagined and gorgeously designed, with colorful, smart graphics that give dimension to figures from Tim "Mechanical Gothic" Duncan to Stephon "Hategoat" Marbury. With a foreword, fittingly, by Gilbert Arenas, the NBA star whose kooky, self-concocted "Agent Zero" persona often overshadows his knee-hobbled game, the <i>Almanac</i> is the ideal midseason treat for the casual fan and the deep obsessive alike. <i>--Tom Nissley</i></p> <p>In the illustrations below, artists from the Free Darko collective give their unique take on two of basketball's "Master Builders"--Kobe Bryant, the perfectionist, and Tim Duncan, a methodical player of gothic proportions. <strong>(Click the images to enlarge)</strong> <br><br></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <br><br>FreeDarko is a collective of like-minded writers and artists (<b>Bethlehem Shoals, Big Baby, Dr. Lawyer IndianChief, Billups, and Silverbird 5000) </b>who gather to celebrate (and take down) the National Basketball Association.

It is a feeling millions of readers have for the Christopher Robin books. <br> <br>The verses here, and in <i>When We Were Very Young</i>, the stories in <i>Winnie-The-Pooh</i> and <i>The House at Pooh Corner</i> have endeared themselves to so many readers that it is painful to try to imagine what the world would be like without them. <br> <br>The perfect book for that all-important birthday, <i>Now We Are Six</i> is much more than a worthy successor to <i>When We Were Very Young</i>; it is a modern classic in its own right. <br> <br>The beguiling verses are rendered more delightful by E.H. Shepard?s enchanting pictures.A.A. Milne grew up in a school - his parents ran Henley House in Kilburn, for young boys - but never intended to be a children&#39;s writer. Pooh he saw as a pleasant sideline to his main career as a playwright and regular scribe for the satirical literary magazine, Punch. Writing was very much the dominant feature of A.A. (Alan Alexander)&#39;s life. He joined the staff of Punch in 1906, and became Assistant Editor. In the course of two decades he fought in the First World War, wrote some 18 plays and three novels, and fathered a son, Christopher Robin Milne, in 1920 (although he described the baby as being more his wife&#39;s work than his own!). Observations of little Christopher led Milne to produce a book of children&#39;s poetry, When We Were Very Young, in 1924, and in 1926 the seminal Winnie-the-Pooh. More poems followed in Now We Are Six (1927) and Pooh returned in The House at Pooh Corner (1928). After that, in spite of enthusiastic demand, Milne declined to write any more children&#39;s stories as he felt that, with his son growing up, they would now only be copies based on a memory. In one way, Christopher Robin turned out to be more famous than his father, though he became uncomfortable with his fame as he got older, preferring to avoid the literary limelight and run a bookshop in Dartmouth. Nevertheless, he published three volumes of his reminiscences before his death in 1996.</p><h2>Can We Rock the Gospel?: Rock Music&#39;s Impact on Worship and Evangelism</h2><p>Can we really combine rock music with the worship of God?

In 1978 Eric made up a story about a small puppy to read to his son at bedtime and Spot was born. The success of his first bestselling lift-the-flap classic Where&#39;s Spot? in 1980 convinced him to become a full-time author, and his Spot books have been enjoyed by children around the world ever since. In 2008 he was awarded an OBE for services to children&#39;s literacy.</p><h2>Cheat (Orca Currents)</h2><p>Laurel discovers her passion for investigative journalism when she writes an article for her school paper about the homeless man who's been living at the school.

Developing and extending the Schenker approach to include modern music, it explores the phenomenon of tonal organization in Western music by means of a detailed analysis and discussion of more than 500 musical examples ranging in time from the Middle Ages to such moderns as Bartok, Hindemith, Prokofiev, and Stravinsky.<br>Heinrich Schenker's great contribution was the discovery of fundamental principles of tonal organization, continuity, and coherence. In theory he was the first to define these organic forces of the musical language, particularly the tonal functions and relationships which form both the generative and cohesive forces of great music.Dr. Salzer, in expanding and formulating anew many of Schenker's ideas, has embarked upon a systematic approach. Using the concept of chord functions as a basis, he differentiates sharply between chord grammar (or labeling) and significance, showing that function rather than the ordinary label is really significant. Further distinctions between chords of structure and chords of prolongation, harmonic and contrapuntal uses, and the concept of musical direction provide effective tools for the analysis of music.<br>This set, which is a standard work used in all important music schools, starts with basic definitions and simple examples, and trains the reader not only to hear successions of tones, melodic lines, and progressions of chords, but also to understand their structural coherence and significance. It is invaluable for musicians and for all who are seriously interested in music, whether as a student, critic, performer, or conductor."Since its publication in 1952 . . . has been the foundation on which all teaching in music theory has been based at this College." &#x2014; Leopold Mannes, President, The Mannes College of Music. "Never likely to be improved upon for soundness and comprehensiveness." &#x2014; Ernest Newman, <i>The Times.</i> "A thoughtful and provocative contribution to the fields of music theory, aesthetics, and criticism, and performance. Dr. Salzer is to be congratulated on having helped us take a long step out of the Dark Ages." &#x2014; Norman Lloyd, Juilliard School of Music, in <i>Notes.</i></p><p></p><h2>Little lost angel</h2><p>A sentimental tale of the littlest angel and of how she got lost on Christmas eve, the night of the nativity, and of how- in trying to catch up- she shared her harp and her crown and her wings with wayfarers in need.

And he&#39;d give anything. Just to cut loose. Just to feel the fire. One more time. And then Ava calls.</p><p>Because of a shocking ending to the first Sin City book, many people wondered how successful Frank Miller could be with future tales of his no-holds-barred city noir. Enter Dwight McCarthy, a clean-living photographer who tries to avoid trouble because he knows what he&#39;s capable of. His tactics don&#39;t do him much good when a girl from his past (who he can&#39;t say no to) shows up and professes her love for him. When he finds out she&#39;s in way over her head, it looks as though trouble has found him. What&#39;s going to happen? You guessed it: people get hurt.Frank Miller began his career in comics in the late 1970s, first drawing then writing Daredevil for Marvel Comics, creating what was essentially a crime comic disguised as a superhero book. It was on Daredevil that Miller gained notoriety, honed his storytelling abilities, and took his first steps toward becoming a giant in the comics medium. <br>After Daredevil came Ronin, a science-fiction samurai drama that seamlessly melded Japanese and French comics traditions into the American mainstream; and after that, the groundbreaking and acclaimed Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and Batman: Year One, both of which not only redefined the classic character, but also revitalized the industry itself.<br>Finally able to fulfill his dream of doing an all-out, straight-ahead crime series, Miller introduced Sin City in 1991. Readers responded enthusiastically to Miller's tough-as-leather noir drama, creating an instant sales success. His multi-award-winning 300 series from Dark Horse, a telling of history's most glorious and underreported battle, was brought to full-blooded life in 1998.<br>In 2001, Miller returned to the superhero genre with the best-selling Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again.<br>Frank Miller continues to push the medium into new territories, exploring subject matter previously untouched in comics, and his work consistently receives the highest praise from his industry peers and readers everywhere. In 2005, with the hugely successful Sin City movie release, co-directed with Robert Rodriguez, Miller added a director's credit to his already impressive resum� and introduced his characters to an entirely new legion of fans worldwide.

Masterfully plotted, <i>The Vault</i> will satisfy both longtime Wexford fans and new Rendell readers.</p><p>Ruth Rendell (1930&#x2013;2015) won three Edgar Awards, the highest accolade from Mystery Writers of America, as well as four Gold Daggers and a Diamond Dagger for outstanding contribution to the genre from England&#x2019;s prestigious Crime Writ�ers&#x2019; Association. Her remarkable career spanned a half century, with more than sixty books published. A member of the House of Lords, she was one of the great literary figures of our time.The Vault <b>1</b><p></p> <br><b>A</b> CURIOUS WORLD WE live in,&#x201d; said Franklin Merton, &#x201c;where one can afford a house but not a picture of a house. That must tell us some profound truth. But what? I wonder.&#x201d;<br> <br>The picture he was talking about was Simon Alpheton&#x2019;s <i>Marc and Harriet in Orcadia Place,</i> later bought by Tate Britain&#x2014;simply &#x201c;the Tate&#x201d; in those days&#x2014;and the house the one in the picture, Orcadia Cottage. His remark about the curious world was addressed to the Harriet of the picture, for whom he had bought it and whom he intended to marry when his divorce came through. Later on, when passion had cooled and they were husband and wife, Franklin said, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to get married. I married you because I&#x2019;m a man of honour and you were my mistress. Some would say my views are out-of-date, but I dispute that. The apparent change is only superficial. I reasoned that no one would want my leavings, so for your sake, the decent thing was to make an honest woman of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>His first wife was Anthea. When he deserted her, he was also obliged to desert their dog, O&#x2019;Hara, and to him that was the most painful thing about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t keep a bitch and bark yourself,&#x201d; he said to Harriet when she protested at having to do all the housework.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pity I&#x2019;m not an Irish setter,&#x201d; she said, and had the satisfaction of seeing him wince.<br> <br>They lived together for five years and were married for twenty-three, the whole time in that house, Orcadia Cottage or number 7a Orcadia Place, London NW8. Owing to Franklin&#x2019;s sharp tongue, verbal cruelty, and indifference, and to Harriet&#x2019;s propensity for sleeping with young tradesmen in the afternoons, it was not a happy marriage. They took separate holidays, Franklin going away ostensibly on his own but in fact with his first wife, and he came back from the last one only to tell Harriet he was leaving. He returned to Anthea and her present Irish setter, De Valera, intending to divorce Harriet as soon as feasible. Anthea, a generous woman, urged him to do his best to search for her, for Harriet couldn&#x2019;t be found at Orcadia Cottage. The largest suitcase, most of her clothes, and the best of the jewellery he had bought her were missing, and Franklin&#x2019;s belief was that she had gone off with her latest young man.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be in touch as soon as she&#x2019;s in need,&#x201d; said Franklin to Anthea, &#x201c;and that won&#x2019;t be long delayed.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Harriet never got in touch. Franklin went back to Orcadia Cottage to look for some clue to where she might have gone but found only that the place was exceptionally neat, tidy, and clean.<br> <br>&#x201c;One odd thing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I lived there for all those years and never went into the cellar. There was no reason to do so. Just the same, I could have sworn there was a staircase going down to it with a door just by the kitchen door. But there isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anthea was a much cleverer woman than Harriet. &#x201c;When you say you could have sworn, darling, do you mean you would go into court, face a jury, and say, &#x2018;I swear there was a staircase in that house going down to the cellar&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>After thinking about it, Franklin said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. Well, no, I wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>He put the house on the market and bought one for Anthea and himself in South Kensington. In their advertisements the estate agents described Orcadia Cottage as &#x201c;the Georgian home immortalized in the internationally acclaimed artwork of Simon Alpheton.&#x201d; The purchasers, an American insurance broker and his wife, wanted to move in quickly, and when Franklin offered them the report his own surveyors had made thirty years before, they were happy to do without a survey. After all, the house had been there for two hundred years and wasn&#x2019;t likely to fall down now.<br> <br>CLAY AND DEVORA SILVERMAN bought the house from Franklin Merton in 1998 and lived there until 2002 before returning to the house they had rented out in Hartford, Connecticut. The first autumn they spent at Orcadia Cottage the leaves on the Virginia creeper which covered the entire front and much of the back of the house turned from green to copper and copper to red and then started to fall off. Clay Silverman watched them settle on the front garden and the paving stones in the back. He was appalled by the red, sticky, sodden mass of leaves on which he and Devora slipped and slid and Devora sprained her ankle. Knowing nothing about natural history and still less about gardening, he was well-informed about art and was familiar with the Alpheton painting. It was one of his reasons for buying Orcadia Cottage. But he had assumed that the green leaves covering the house that formed the background to the lovers&#x2019; embrace remained green always and remained on the plant. After all of them had fallen, he had the creeper cut down.<br> <br>Orcadia Cottage emerged as built of bricks in a pretty pale red colour. Clay had shutters put on the windows and the front door painted a pale greenish gray. In the paved yard at the back of the house was what he saw as an unsightly drain cover with a crumbling stone pot on top of it. He had a local nursery fill a tub with senecios, heathers, and cotoneaster to replace the pot. But four years later he and Devora moved out and returned home. Clay Silverman had given �800,000 for the house and sold it for �1.5 million to Martin and Anne Rokeby.<br> <br>The Rokebys had a son and daughter; there were only two bedrooms in Orcadia Cottage, but one was large enough to be divided and this was done. For the first time in nearly half a century the house was home to children. Again there was no survey on the house, for Martin and Anne paid cash and needed no mortgage. They moved into Orcadia Cottage in 2002 and had been living there for four years, their children teenagers by this time, when Martin raised the possibility with his wife of building underground. Excavations to construct an extra room or two&#x2014;a wine cellar, say, or a &#x201c;family room,&#x201d; a study, or all of those things&#x2014;were becoming fashionable. You couldn&#x2019;t build on to your historic house or add an extra story, but the planning authority might let you build subterraneanly. A similar thing had been done in Hall Road, which was near Orcadia Place, and Martin had watched the project with interest.<br> <br>A big room under Orcadia Cottage would be just the place for their children to have a large-screen television, their computers, their ever-more-sophisticated arrangements for making music, and maybe an exercise room too for Anne, who was something of a workout fanatic. In the late summer of 2006 Martin began by consulting the builders who had divided the large bedroom, but they had gone out of business. A company whose board outside the Hall Road house gave their name, phone number, and an e-mail address were next. But the men who came round to have a look said it wouldn&#x2019;t be feasible. A different firm was recommended to him by a neighbour. One who came said he thought it could be done. Another said it was possible if Martin didn&#x2019;t mind losing all the mature trees in the front garden.<br> <br>Martin and Anne and the children all went to Australia for a month. The house was too old, prospective builders said; it would be unwise to disturb the foundations. Others said it could be done but at a cost twice that which Martin had estimated. They said all this on the phone without even looking at it. Nevertheless, he applied to the planning authority for permission to build underneath the house. The project was put an end to when planning permission was refused, having had a string of protests from all the Rokebys&#x2019; neighbours except the one who had recommended the builder.<br> <br>All this took about a year. In the autumn of 2007 the Rokebys&#x2019; son, who had been the principal family member in favour of the underground room, went off to university. Time went on and the plan was all but forgotten. The house seemed bigger now their daughter was away at boarding school. In the early spring of 2009 Martin and Anne went on holiday to Florence. There, in a shop on the Arno, Anne fell in love with a large amphora displayed in its window. Apparently dredged up from the waters of the Mediterranean, it bore a frieze round its rim of nymphs and satyrs dancing and wreathing each other with flowers.<br> <br>&#x201c;I must have that,&#x201d; said Anne. &#x201c;Imagine that replacing that hideous old pot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have it,&#x201d; Martin said. &#x201c;Why not? So long as you don&#x2019;t try getting it on the flight.&#x201d;<br> <br>The shop sent it, carefully packed in a huge crate, and it finally arrived in St. John&#x2019;s Wood in May 2009 by some circuitous route not involving aircraft. A local nursery agreed to plant it with agapanthus and <i>Sedum spectabile,</i> but before this was done, Martin emptied the plants and soil out of the wooden tub, placed the remains of the tub into a black plastic bag, and put it out into the mews for the rubbish collection.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve often wondered what&#x2019;s under that lid thing but never bothered to have a look.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Now&#x2019;s your chance,&#x201d; said Anne, uninterested.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably too heavy to lift.&#x201d;<br> <br>But it wasn&#x2019;t too heavy. Martin lifted the manhole cover to disclose a large, dark cavity. He could see nothing much beyond what appeared to be a plastic bag or sheet of plastic lying in the depths. Better get a torch, he thought, and he did, thus wrecking his life for a long time to come.<br> <br>An exaggeration? Perhaps. But not much of one. By shining that torch down into the dark cavity, he gained a place for his wife and himself and his home on the front page of every daily newspaper, put an end to his and his family&#x2019;s peace for months, attracting mobs of sightseers to the street and the mews, reducing the selling price of his house by about a million pounds, and making Orcadia Place as notorious as Christie&#x2019;s home in Notting Hill and the Wests&#x2019; in Gloucester.</p><h2>The Most Wonderful Doll in the World</h2><p>Everyday, Dulcy, an imaginative little girl, had dreamed about her wonderful, long-lost doll, Angela, but when Dulcy finally finds Angela, the doll is not at all like the one she remembered</p><p></p><h2>Kwik Sew Method for Sewing Lingerie</h2><p>Creating one&#39;s own lingerie opens the door to let every woman be creative - as creative as she wishes, for lingerie, more than anything else, gives her the opportunity to use her imagination.

He&#x2019;d seen it crossing a bay south of the island where I grew up and still occasionally reside.<br><br>&#x201c;How far south?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A ways. We were flying back from Key West.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where you disappeared to?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been traveling,&#x201d; he said, which was typical. &#x201c;It was a Burmese python&#x2014;twelve, maybe fifteen feet long. Too big for a boa. Hard to be sure of the size because it was swimming, but that&#x2019;s not the point.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is to me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re trying to scare me into moving closer to your lab, I&#x2019;m flattered, but I&#x2019;d prefer the particulars first. There are better ways than inventing snakes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Invent?&#x201d; He was mystified. Marion has warmth, if you get to know him, but he is slow to recognize playful humor.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t doubt you saw it, but there&#x2019;s a hundred miles of coast between here and the Keys. Was the snake closer to Naples or Sanibel Island?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me finish. I was making a connection between the parasites killing your orange trees and higher-profile exotics like pythons, boas, a whole long list of reptiles that are taking over the state. Not just reptiles, of course. Fire ants have all but destroyed the quail population. Brazilian pepper trees are another example, but they were intentionally introduced by state biologists, so&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Marion,&#x201d; I said patiently, &#x201c;you know I&#x2019;m not fond of snakes, and you know why. Please stick to the subject.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thought I was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were for a while. Now you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;<br><br>I was aboard a tidy Marlow cabin cruiser that is my home, neatening up the galley, with the phone to my ear.

Across the road, atop an Indian mound, was an old yellow-pine Cracker house with a tin roof and a wraparound porch. Veiled by screening were ceiling fans, a summer kitchen, and a hammock where, as a child, I had often slept on hot summer nights.<br><br>What I chose not to notice was a black Lincoln Town Car parked in the shade. For more than an hour, I&#x2019;d been trying to ignore the thing. It belonged to an old-time Florida millionaire who, twenty years ago, had been my mother&#x2019;s secret lover. Two brain surgeries and a fondness for smoking pot have not improved her memory, nor pacified her mood swings and sometimes wild behavior.<br><br>Better, I&#x2019;d decided, to call a friend rather than fixate on what might be going on up there. Inside, it was just the two of them: my mother, Loretta, and eighty-year-old Harney Chatham, the former lieutenant governor of Florida, who was also a married man.<br><br>Not that anyone remembers lieutenant governors. Even Mr. Chatham&#x2019;s recent prostate surgery had not made the news.<br><br>Ford asked, &#x201c;Are you still there?&#x201d;<br><br>I realized my attention had drifted. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not one to interrupt, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m not listening. How big was the snake?&#x201d;<br><br>Apparently, he had already covered that ground. Instead of sighing, as a normal person would, he calmly repeated the �details&#x2014;a quality that was admirable, I suppose, but also rankled me. It was as if he were a professor tutoring one of his slower students.<br><br>&#x201c;Hannah,&#x201d; he added, &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t heard from you in more than three weeks&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You disappeared a month ago, so what do you expect?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t disappear, I was traveling,&#x201d; he reminded me. &#x201c;Now, out of the blue, you call to tell me the oranges in your citrus grove are dying. Why ask me for advice?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re <i>withering</i>,&#x201d; I corrected, &#x201c;with a sort of green mold on the skins, and the fruit&#x2019;s bitter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The entire grove?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The ones I care about. The honeybells and grapefruit, all my favorites. You can tell by the leaves. They start to curl up, with yellow streaks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But not all?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think to check.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should. If some of the trees aren&#x2019;t infected, I&#x2019;d step back&nbsp;and ask myself what&#x2019;s different about them? Less shade, more sun&#x2014;a different soil or rootstock? But if the entire grove is �diseased&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not big enough to be called a grove; not really. Just a few dozen trees my grandfather planted way, way back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. All I&#x2019;m saying is, you must have ties to people in the citrus business who can give you better advice than me.&#x201d;<br><br>Again, my eyes moved to the black limousine. &#x201c;Some of the biggest,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;but I do miss our talks. You&#x2019;re a biologist, and it&#x2019;s been a while, so I thought maybe you&#x2019;d heard something new.&#x201d;<br><br>This, he found humorous. &#x201c;The parasites that spread citrus greening don&#x2019;t have fins, and they don&#x2019;t swim. I&#x2019;m a <i>marine </i>biologist. All I know is, they&#x2019;re exotics, and they&#x2019;ve damn near ruined a billion-dollar industry. Is that really the reason you called?&#x201d;<br><br>I was about to cover my deception by shifting topics when I saw Loretta charge out of the house wearing a housecoat and fluffy pink slippers. Her mannerisms were frantic as if she were being chased, or had suffered a second brain aneurysm. She bounced on her toes and flapped her hands in my direction, then charged back onto the porch.<br><br>&#x201c;Something&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Nothing we can&#x2019;t fix, Hannah, if you&#x2019;re willing to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not us, my crazy mother,&#x201d; I interrupted, and went out the cabin door in a hurry.<br><br>The former lieutenant governor was either dead or in a bad way. I knew it when Loretta blocked me from the porch, saying, &#x201c;Even as a child you had a selfish streak. Now you refuse to do me this one little favor?&#x201d;<br><br>The favor she had demanded was, &#x201c;Go away, and, for god&#x2019;s sake, don&#x2019;t call the law. It&#x2019;s too late to save your mama from �sinning&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But you didn&#x2019;t hear that from me. I&#x2019;m not gonna confess to anything.&#x201d;<br><br>I felt a little dizzy when I heard those words. &#x201c;Where is he, Loretta?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think I recognize his car? If Mr. Chatham is sick, we need to do something. Please tell me something terrible hasn&#x2019;t happened.&#x201d;<br><br>She stared at the Lincoln Town Car and hyperventilated.<br><br>&#x201c;Loretta, move. If Reggie&#x2019;s sleeping in the backseat, go bang on the window and get him up here. I&#x2019;ll look for myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Reggie was Mr. Chatham&#x2019;s limo driver.<br><br>&#x201c;Not until I think this through,&#x201d; she snapped, and squared herself in front of the door. Loretta isn&#x2019;t a large woman&#x2014;not compared to me, her only child&#x2014;but she has a magic way of puffing herself while her bright blue eyes catch fire. &#x201c;For once in your life, do something to make me happy, Hannah. Just go away and leave us be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not leaving until&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do as you&#x2019;re told, young lady!&#x201d; she hollered, and glared with those wild eyes of hers.<br><br>For an instant, I was a child again, standing in the same doorway of the same house that hadn&#x2019;t changed much since my mother had stung me with similar words many times, over many years. But that girl was long gone, along with her timid nature. &#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t move, I&#x2019;ll go &#x2019;round to the back door. Or pick you up and carry you to the couch. Is that what you want? The two of us wrestling around like crazy people while we could be helping?&#x201d; Then I called over the top of her head, &#x201c;Mr. Chatham! Everything okay in there? It&#x2019;s me, Hannah Smith.&#x201d;<br><br>On the mantel above the fireplace is a cherrywood clock my great-grandfather made when he wasn&#x2019;t fishing mullet, or selling rum and egret plumes. The clock&#x2019;s ticking was the only reply.<br><br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; I murmured. &#x201c;Loretta, talk to me. Please tell me you did not do something crazy. You didn&#x2019;t stab him, did you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stab him! &#x2019;Course I didn&#x2019;t. In my own bed? What do you think I am?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My lord,&#x201d; I said again. &#x201c;Is that where he is?&#x201d;<br><br>With a dazed look, she turned toward the hall, her bedroom beyond, then appeared to wilt and stepped away. &#x201c;When the law comes, I suppose you&#x2019;ll tell them the governor ain&#x2019;t the first man I killed.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Kilt</i> is the way the word is pronounced in the small fishing communities of Southwest Florida.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s <i>dead</i>?<i>&#x201d;</i><br><br>&#x201c;I believe he is,&#x201d; was her cryptic reply, &#x201c;but Harney&#x2019;s not the type to give up all at once.&#x201d; She began to sob.<br><br>I rushed into the house to where Loretta&#x2019;s recliner faced the TV, which wasn&#x2019;t blaring soap operas for a change. Nearby was her walker. It was covered with a caftan as a vanity. Aside from confiding to a few women friends, she won&#x2019;t admit she needs help getting around, not even to our handsome UPS man, let alone a former lover. I slid the walker within reach and hurried down the&nbsp;hall, calling the governor&#x2019;s name.<br><br>The door to my old room was open, nothing I recognized on the walls or desk. Loretta&#x2019;s door was shut tight, which was normal. As always, I could feel the privacy of shadows and forbidden drawers radiating from within. Twice I knocked, then bumped the door open. After a look, I hollered, &#x201c;Call nine-one-one. Hurry!&#x201d; but didn&#x2019;t budge for a moment because my legs felt watery, like in a bad dream.<br><br>In life, Mr. Chatham was an imposing man with oversized accomplishments. He favored Western-cut suits, string bolo ties, and the only time he removed his hat was when entering a house, or greeting a lady, or before sliding into the back of his limo.<br><br>His cowboy hat&#x2014;&#x201c;my John Wayne Stetson,&#x201d; he called it&#x2014;was the only reason I knew for certain the man who lay there, toes up and naked with vomit crusted on his chin, was the former lieutenant governor. My mother, despite her panic, had had the good manners to place the hat strategically over his pelvis. The Stetson tilted, as if on a peg, the man&#x2019;s two long, heavy legs sticking out. I charged in and did what I&#x2019;d been taught in a CPR course I had to take when I&#x2019;d upgraded my captain&#x2019;s license. Mr. Chatham&#x2019;s neck was as white and cool as clay when I felt for a pulse. Glassy eyes failed to respond to my shouting, nor when I hammered a fist on his chest.<br><br>Next step: clear the airway, then begin mouth-to-mouth. Practicing on a CPR dummy had not prepared me for the realities involved. But I did as I&#x2019;d been taught. Billowed two breaths into his lungs, then shouted out the compressions in a robotic way while I pumped his chest. This helped stem a blooming nausea.<br><br>&#x201c;Mama&#x2014;you&#x2019;d best be dialing that damn phone! Carry it outside while you talk, and bring Reggie fast as you can.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no need to add this because the chauffeur was suddenly beside me, hands on my shoulders, and cooing in his gentle Southern way. &#x201c;You done what you could, Miz Hannah. Go on now, girl, an&#x2019; leave the rest to me.&#x201d;<br><br>I stepped back and brushed hair from my face. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s got no pulse. Did Loretta call nine-one-one?&#x201d;<br><br>Reggie, a tiny, wiry man, was wearing the same blue cap he always wore. &#x201c;All taken care of,&#x201d; he said. Then he removed his driving gloves and yelled, &#x201c;Governor! Wake up, sir. This is ain&#x2019;t no place for this to be happening.&#x201d;<br><br>He plopped down, grabbed the man who&#x2019;d been his employer for decades, shook him by the shoulders, and looked up at me with wide eyes. &#x201c;Lord God, he&#x2019;s cold as death, Miz Hannah. His heart done stopped. I knew this was gonna happen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be sure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cold as he is? Honey, he&#x2019;s been gone a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have to keep doing compressions until&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know,&#x201d; the little man said, yet sounded resigned. &#x201c;I took that course for my chauffeur&#x2019;s license, but the governor wouldn&#x2019;t like it, you seeing what I gotta do first.&#x201d; He glanced at the Stetson, as if to convey his meaning, then hunched his back and continued CPR. Between breaths he told me, &#x201c;Leave us alone, girl. It&#x2019;s what he&#x2019;d want.&#x201d;<br><br>I was duty-bound to stay but suddenly in need of air. In the bathroom, I left the water running to cover the sound of my nausea, then washed my face and went searching for my mother. She was on the porch, rocking and staring past the mangroves that fringe our dock. It was a cool, bright afternoon in February, with the sky too low for soaring gulls and frigate birds. When I covered her legs with a blanket, she spoke in a monotone. &#x201c;No need to badger me, I know it&#x2019;s my fault. He warned me often enough.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t fret about that now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m being punished for doin&#x2019; what I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t do. I, by god, deserve whatever hell has to offer, &#x2019;cause that&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;m headed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t say such things. Do you mean Mr. Chatham mentioned he had heart problems? I think that&#x2019;s what happened. He had a heart attack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t him who warned me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind. The governor&#x2019;s problems always started way south of his heart. We was both that way, God help us. That&#x2019;s why he had that thingamabob installed. I knew we was playing with fire but couldn&#x2019;t stop myself.&#x201d;<br><br>Rather than endure further details, I offered to make a pitcher of sweet tea. My mother rocked and stared.<br><br>&#x201c;Earthly pleasures are a trap, Hannah. Chastity might seem its own punishment&#x2014;until you accept a man from the spirit world. That&#x2019;s when our behavior is supposed to change. Oh, I knew what I was doing.&#x201d;<br><br>There is often no making sense of her babbling. I hugged my mother close as she cried, her shoulders bird-like. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the home health nurse and have her come early. Or would you rather I have the ladies come keep you company?&#x201d;<br><br>I was referring to Loretta&#x2019;s friends from childhood, Epsey Hendry, Becky Darwin, and Jody Summerlin&#x2014;all widows. Once a week, they would gather on the porch, with cookies, or a&nbsp;pie or brownies, and wait for the church shuttle to carry them to bingo.<br><br>There would be no bingo on this Friday night.<br><br>I gave her another hug, called Becky Darwin without explaining why she was needed, then went inside to check on Reggie. In the hall, I stopped out of respect. He was weeping, but in an angry way, and speaking in low tones to his former employer.&nbsp;Eavesdropping is not something I normally do, yet what I heard was so unexpected, I found myself drawn toward the open door.<br><br>I heard the chauffeur mutter, &#x201c;Where the hell is the damn shutoff valve? I ain&#x2019;t gettin&#x2019; paid to put my hands on your&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no, I ain&#x2019;t. I warned you, Governor&#x2014;by god, I warned you&#x2014;now here we are. And who gonna explain this to that bitch you married if I can&#x2019;t&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ? Shit fire! How&#x2019;s this damn contraption work?&#x201d;<br></i></p><h2>Showdown at Opal Creek: The Battle for America&#39;s Last Wilderness</h2><p>An account of the conflict over whether to preserve or cut down forests in Oregon&#39;s Cascade Mountains</p><p>A moving account of personalities and politics in the on-going battle over logging the last areas of old-growth forest in the heart of Oregon's Cascade Range, from Time reporter Seideman (The New Republic, 1986--not reviewed). Concentrating on two primary players in the dispute surrounding the ancient forest at Opal Creek, Seideman's narrative- -as the story unfolds in the late 1980's--quickly allows the individual acrimony and psychological effects of the controversy to surface. To George Atiyeh--a logger-turned-environmentalist from a prominent Oregon family--Opal Creek is a church, and his willingness to use every means necessary to protect it from cutting--including media manipulation, state and federal legislation, and endless legal maneuvers against the US Forest Service--made him a contemptible turncoat in the eyes of his hometown community of Mill City. To Tom Hirons--an independent timber-company owner--dwindling logging prospects and the struggle to gain access to Opal Creek meant teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, but at the same time being pushed into the limelight as an articulate spokesman for the plight of loggers like himself. Atiyeh and Hirons had been best friends and business partners, and the animosity accompanying their falling-out made any negotiations thorny. With national media exposure, their positions stiffened further, but efforts to compromise stayed alive in part because they couldn't completely forget their friendship. The two are now reconciled to a degree, although the final chapter on Opal Creek remains to be written. What seems clear is that the area's clearcutting heyday is a thing of the past. Well informed, if long-winded, and adept at revealing the human faces behind the issues, with genuine sympathy for those hurt by the decline of Oregon's timber industry. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Opal Creek, in the Willamette National Forest, comprises 6800 acres of virgin forest, the largest stand remaining in western Oregon. Since 1970, 38% of the state's old-growth forests has been logged while 25,000 woodworkers have lost jobs due to automation. Rich in wildlife and home to the spotted owl, Opal Creek is central to the land use controversy pitting economic interests against the environment. Time reporter David Seideman ( The New Republic ) explores this conflict in the richly detailed stories of two men on opposite sides. George Atiyeh has been fighting to save the forest for 20 years; Tom Hirons is a logger whose livelihood in nearby Mill City is threatened. Both have presented their views on national television. Seideman offers a balanced account of their conflict, noting that in the Northwest, the logger is a cultural icon comparable to the cowboy. He examines the politics and policies surrounding the timber industry, and points a finger of blame directly at Congress (the Forest Service receives criticism, too). Atiyeh and Hirons ultimately reach a compromise, but the fate of Opal Creek remains uncertain.

Insects on Display is the perfect next step to help children display the specimens they captured and cared for using The Insect Book: A Basic Guide to the Collection and Care of Common Insects for Young Children, also by Connie Zakowski. Insects on Display will teach you how to Identify insect body parts Mount butterflies and moths Mount hard-shell insects Handle difficult-to-mount insects Display specimens in cases and domes Features: Illustrated skills Supplies and suppliers lists Glossary Suggested Reading Index</p><p>Connie Zakowski has taken you another step farther into the world of insect collecting. Just as her first book, The Insect Book, taught you how to collect and care for insects, Insects on Display has illustrated how to preserve your specimens. Connie lives in southeastern Wisconsin, where summer months have provided her the opportunity to raise several insect species. Her most recent &#x201c;family&#x201d; consisted of Cecropia and Polyphemus caterpillars, which she raised from the eggs of mated moths of each species. Collecting all the food and caring for the caterpillars is time-consuming, and it kept her very busy. She enjoyed watching them grow, day by day. As summer comes to an end, the caterpillars will all make cocoons, and they will be returned to nature to spend the winter months in their natural environment. During the winter months, when the insects are dormant, Connie spends her time creating displays of her specimens so they can be seen close-up for all the years to come. Connie enjoys giving lectures and showing off her collection to different schools, youth organizations, and senior citizens&#x2019; groups. During the winter, she brings her prepared displays; during summer, she brings live specimens. The reaction she receives from these presentations is rewarding. It always generates many entertaining stories of the viewers&#x2019; encounters with the insect world. The study of entomology has been an interesting and educational avocation for Connie. She still finds a little extra time for photography and plans to include this hobby in her future endeavors.</p><h2>An American Haunting: The Bell Witch</h2><p><p>Known throughout Tennessee as "Old Kate," the Bell Witch took up residence with John Bell's family in 1818.

And both are closer than she ever imagined. . .</p><p>Lisa Jackson has been writing romantic fiction for fifteen years. Over sixty of her books have been published and reprinted in more than a dozen foreign languages. A single mother, she is a native of Oregon, where she still resides with her two teenage sons. Lisa is often asked what is the key to her success, and her unfailing answer is a keen imagination, incredible friends, loving family, and always, loads of laughter. As Oscar Wilde is purported to have said, &#34;Life is too important to be taken seriously.&#34;Another serial killer is wreaking havoc in New Orleans, and it's up to detectives Rick Bentz and Reuben Montoya, the protagonists from Jackson's previous thriller, Hot Blooded, to reign him in. This time around, the detectives are joined by Olivia Benchet, a reluctant psychic who hails from a highly dysfunctional family. Olivia's visions of a priestly killer who tortures and sacrifices young females provide Bentz and Montoya with their best clues, but Olivia may be the next victim if Bentz doesn't shrug off his cynicism concerning visions and romantic entanglements with the wild-haired psychic. Twice burned by his former wife, who had an affair with his half-brother, Bentz now lives for work and his rebellious, 19-year-old daughter, Kristi. The hunt for the murderer escalates when Olivia realizes her visions are a two-way mirror, and the killer has Kristi and Olivia in his sights. Jackson's sanctimonious serial killer, who refers to himself as The Chosen One, is stock, but the dynamics between her protagonists, particularly between Bentz and Olivia, are a welcome counterpoint to the violent action. Although some readers may be repulsed by the killer's sexually sadistic crimes, which are depicted in graphic detail,others will be intrigued by Jackson's portrayal of the grotesqueries that result when faith and family are perverted. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Dollhouse Magic</h2><p>Gives instructions for making simple dollhouse furniture and accessories from household odds and ends.</p><p></p><h2>Deepening Your Conversation With God (Pastor&#39;s Soul)</h2><p>Learn to Love to Pray<br>If you long to call your prayer time "sweet," but usally find it flat or without taste...<br><br>If you thirst to know God through prayer, but too often fail to find the time for prayer...<br><br>If you desire conversation wtih God, but tend toward a monologue instead...<br><br>Ben Patterson, with "I've been there too" reassurance, will encourage and inspire you to turn your prayers from a spiritual discipline to a much-anticipated delight.

To some religious conservatives, McLaren is a dangerous rebel without a doctrinally-correct cause. Some fundamentalist websites have even claimed he's in league with the devil and have consigned him to flames.</p><p>To others though, Brian is a fresh voice, a welcome antidote to the staleness, superficiality, and negativity of the religious status quo. A wide array of people from Evangelical, Catholic, and Mainline Protestant backgrounds claim that through his books they have begun to rediscover the faith they'd lost or rejected. And around the world, many readers say that he has helped them find-for the first time in their lives-a faith that makes sense and rings true. For many, he articulates the promise of what is being called "emerging Christianity."</p><p>In <i>The Secret Message of Jesus</i> you'll find what's at the center of Brian's critique of conventional Christianity, and what's at the heart of his expanding vision.

McLaren (MA, University of Maryland) is an author, speaker, activist and public theologian. After teaching college English, Brian pastored Cedar Ridge Community Church in the Baltimore-Washington, DC area. Brain has been active in networking and mentoring church planters and pastors for over 20 years. He is a popular conference speaker and a frequent guest lecturer for denominational and ecumenical leadership gatherings in the US and internationally.<i>Starred Review.</i> Pastor and bestselling author McLaren (<i>A New Kind of Christian</i>) explores Jesus's teaching in this book, placing it in its Jewish context, analyzing its tenets and expression, and trying to work out how it should be lived today. McLaren starts with the assumption that the church may not have accurately understood Jesus's "secret message" (hidden "as a treasure one must seek in order to find"). He revisits the gospel material from a fresh&#x2014;and at times radical&#x2014;perspective. The church has focused on salvation as a means to "heaven after you die" for too long, according to McLaren; we should take Jesus at his word when he says "the kingdom of God is here now," and work to assist that kingdom by being peacemakers and loving others. McLaren admits to not exploring every topic here in depth, in an effort to keep the book brief, but he does an excellent job of capturing Jesus's quiet, revolutionary style&#x2014;the prophet who spoke in parables, who didn't want people to talk about his miracles, who challenged established Jewish thought, and paradoxically found ultimate fulfillment and victory through death. Conservative evangelicals will be critical of some points (and there are weaknesses here), but this book will appeal to a broad spectrum of people who want to understand Jesus. <i>(Apr. 4)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The second volume in a three-volume commentary, it easily maintains the high standards of academic excellence established by <i>Isaiah</i> <i>1&#x2014;39</i>.<br><br>Second Isaiah was written in the sixth century b.c.e., in the years just before the fall of the mighty Babylonian Empire, by an anonymous prophet whom history has erroneously identified with the real Isaiah (born ca. 765 b.c.e.). Scholars know Second Isaiah was written by someone other than Isaiah because the contexts of these prophecies are so very different. When Second Isaiah was written, the prophet believed that Israel&#x2019;s time of suffering was drawing to a close. There was, he insisted, a new age upon them, a time of hope, peace, and renewed national prosperity. The main thrust of the prophet&#x2019;s argument was intended to rally the spirits of a people devastated by war and conquest. One of the most famous examples of this optimistic tone is the well-known and beloved Song of the Suffering Servant, which is found in Chapters 52&#x2014;53, and about which Blenkinsopp has some challenging new ideas. <br><br>The final chapters of Second Isaiah, however, are in an entirely different key as it becomes clear that the new world the prophet foresaw earlier was not going to come to pass. This despair finds its most poignant expression in the final section of the Book of Isaiah, which Blenkinsopp will address in his forthcoming third volume.</p><p><b>JOSEPH BLENKINSOPP</b> is currently the John A.

Cowboy,'' queues up an all-too-loose history of FM free-form radio, from the rock revolution of the Sixties to the ``classic rock'' stations of the late 1980's. Although he calls this ``a true story based on actual events,'' Ladd has inexplicably changed the names of many of the personalities and radio stations involved, providing only an unannotated general list of the real names. The origins of the ``tribal drum,'' ``the soundtrack of our lives,'' Ladd says, go back to 1967, when ``Big Daddy'' Tom Donahue (apparently not a pseudonym) set up shop in Haight-Ashbury and ``treated the music as an art rather than a product.'' Ladd's own FM history began in Long Beach as a gofer at ``KBRK.'' He soon moved to a network ``format'' station that even in 1969 was highly mechanized and corporate. After syndicating his own program, ``Innerview,'' featuring the likes of John Lennon, Alice Cooper, and the Grateful Dead, he refused an order to give it up and ``defected'' to ``KAOS.'' He was there for 15 years before he was fired for a midnight tirade against ``formula radio'' and his refusal to do ``dentist office music for yuppies.'' Ladd's confrontations with management over running ``commercials for the military,'' the behind-the-scenes glimpse he provides of Patty Hearst, and excerpts from his interviews with Lennon and others provide some fun and interest. And his story of initiating a telephone campaign to the Carter White House to protest the spraying of marijuana with herbicides is a gem. Unfortunately, the good parts are dwarfed by lengthy stretches describing how uptight management could be and how groovy everyone else was--although apparently not groovy enough to use their real names. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This account of Ladd's career as a Los Angeles FM radio disc jockey spans the late 1960s to the late 1980s. Ladd begins with a summary of the rise of free-form FM radio as an alternative to top-40 programming under Tom Donahue at KMPX and later KSAN in San Francisco. He masks many names and stations' call letters in pseudonyms, diminishing his book's value as a historical account. However, his story is by turns inspiring and infuriating, as we read of the creative new medium being gradually co-opted by its corporate ownership and forced into a strict programming format adhering to market research. Ladd offers appealing reading for those with an interest in 1960s culture, rock music, and broadcast media. His anecdotal insider's view of the radio industry fills a subject gap, and, therefore, most public libraries should have it.<br><i>-David Dodd, Benicia P.L., Cal.</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>My Quest for Yeti: Confronting the Himalayas&#39; Deepest Mystery</h2><p>One of the world&#39;s great mountain climbers returns to the Himalayan Mountains, where he explores the mystery of Yeti, or &#34;abominable snowman&#34;. Original.</p><p>Reinhold Messner, the famed Austrian alpinist, has spent much of three decades climbing in the Himalayas--and, as it turns out, looking along the way for evidence of the yeti, the legendary, supposedly humanoid inhabitant of the high mountains. Messner writes of having encountered "an apparition" at the Tibetan headwaters of the Mekong River. Remembering a photograph of a mysteriously shaped footprint that Eric Shipton had taken years earlier, Messner began to collect evidence--tracks, eerie cries and whistles, fleeting glimpses--of the fabled abominable snowman. With that mounting evidence, he writes, "the mountains that I knew so well now seemed smothered in mystery." Of the yeti's existence, the climber has no doubt; his pages are taken up by his quest for plausible answers as to the creature's real identity. He writes of possibilities that many scientists have discounted--for instance, that the yeti may be a kind of ape, or perhaps a long-diverged species of bear--dismissing knee-jerk unbelievers with an impatient wave, and turning in a lively natural history of an unknown being.<p> With this memoir, Messner is in good literary company--Peter Matthiessen and Slavomir Rawicz, among others, have written of high-mountain encounters with yetis--and in fine form. Readers with an interest in cryptozoology and mountaineering alike will delight in his findings. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Making my way through some ash-colored junipers, I suddenly heard an eerie sound-a histling noise, similar to the warning call mountain goats make. Out of the corner of my eye I saw the outline of a upright figure dart between the trees to the edge of the clearing, where low-growing thickets covered the steep slope...The creature towered menacingly, its face a gray shadow, its body a blck outline. Covered with hair, it stoodupright on two short legs and had powerful arms that hung down almost to its knees. I guessed it to be over seven feel tall. Its body looked much heavier than that of a man of that size, bt it moved with such agility and power toward the edge of the encampment that I was both startled and relieved. <i>-From My Quest for the Yeti</i></p><h2>First and Last Freedom</h2><p>Paperback.

The shades were drawn, and a dog lay motionless on the front porch. A thin stream of smoke flowed out of the chimney and headed west, across the rural Maryland countryside toward Washington, D.C. Inside, a man sat silently in front of the fireplace, shoving stacks of paper into the hot flames.<br>The papers were the product of months of tedious and meticulous work. Each sheet represented hour upon hour of surveillance notes, in-depth subject profiles, and maps of neighborhoods throughout the D.C. metropolitan area. He knew when the police patrolled, when the newspapers were delivered, who jogged and at what time, and most importantly, where his targets slept and what time they awoke.<br>He and his men had stalked them for months, watching and waiting, patiently discerning which part of their daily routine could be exploited -- and when they would be most vulnerable. His strong hands reached for the fire and stopped short. Letting them hang near the flames, he flexed them straight, then pulled them into tight fists. The men he had been stalking had sent him to some of the most obscure places on the face of the planet to kill people who were deemed a threat to the national security of the United States of America.<br>He had lost track of the number of people he had killed in the service of his country. He had not intentionally blocked the tally from his mind, it was just something he had never bothered to calculate. Whatever the number was, he held no regrets for the men he had killed. They were honorless, evil psychopaths -- killers of innocent civilians.<br>The solitary figure sitting in front of the fire was an assassin of assassins, an exporter of death, trained and funded by the United States government. His short blond hair glowed as he stared deeper and deeper into the flames, the crisp fire eventually turning into a hypnotic blur. Tomorrow he would kill for the first time on American soil. The times, places, and targets had all been chosen. in less than twenty-four hours the course of American politics would be changed forever.<br><br>The sun rose over Washington, D.C., marking the start of what would be a long and busy day. With the president's annual budget twenty-four hours away from a full House vote, the town was in a frenzy. Congressmen, senators, bureaucrats, and lobbyists were making a last-minute push to amend or strike certain elements of the budget. The count was too close to call, and the leaders of both parties were exerting great pressure on their members to vote along partisan lines.<br>No one was exerting more pressure than Stu Garret, the president's chief of staff. It was nearing 9 A.M., and Garret was ready to explode. He was standing in the Blue Room of the White House watching the president read "Humpty-Dumpty" to a group of kindergartners, and his anger was increasing by the second. Garret had told the president that the photo op with the kids was out of the question, but the White House press secretary, Ann Moncur, had convinced the president otherwise. It was rare for Garret to lose to anyone; even on the smallest point. But Moncur had sold the president on the idea that, in the throes of a cutthroat budget battle, it would be good PR for him to look as if he were above the dirty political horse-trading of Washington.<br>Garret had been working around the clock for the last month trying to get the votes needed to pass the budget. If the budget was defeated, their chances for reelection would be severely hampered. The count would be close, but there was a plan to make a last-minute charge. The only problem was that Garret needed the president back in his office making phone calls, not sitting in the Blue Room reading nursery rhymes.<br>As was typical of everything at the White House, the event had started late and was now running over its original half-hour slot. Garret looked down at his watch for the tenth time in the last five minutes and decided enough was enough. Looking to his left, he glared at Ann Moncur, who was standing several feet away. Garret slid between the wall and several other White House staffers and worked his way toward Moncur. When he reached her, he pulled her back and cupped his hand over her ear. "This is the dumbest stunt you've ever pulled. If the budget gets torpedoed tomorrow, you're history. This circus has gone fifteen minutes over schedule. I'm going to the Oval Office, and if he isn't there in five minutes, I'm going to come back in here and personally throw your ass out on the street."<br>Moncur strained to smile and look relaxed. She glanced around the room and noticed that some of the other staffers and several members of the press were watching. She nodded her head several times and was relieved when Garret stepped away and headed for the door. For obvious reasons, Moncur didn't care for the older, crass chief of staff. Simply put, he was a pain in the ass to work for.<br><br>Michael O'Rourke walked purposefully down the hallway of the Cannon House Office Building. It was just after 9 A.M., and the building was crowded with people. O'Rourke avoided making eye contact with anyone for fear of being stopped. He was not in a good mood. O'Rourke didn't like Washington; in fact, it was safe to say he hated Washington. Midway down the hall, he turned into an office and closed the door behind him.<br>Inside were five men wearing dark suits and drinking coffee. O'Rourke shot his secretary a quick glance, but before she could respond, all five men closed in on him.<br>"Congressman O'Rourke, could I please have a moment of your time? I just need five minutes," pleaded the man closest to the door.<br>A short, pudgy man pushed his way to the front.<br>"Congressman, I would like to speak to you about how the farmers in your district will be affected if you don't vote for the president's budget."<br>The thirty-two-year-old freshman congressman held up his hands. "Gentlemen, you're wasting your time. I've already made up my mind, and I will not be voting for the president's budget. Now if you will kindly vacate my office, I have work to do." The group started to protest, but O'Rourke opened the door and waved them into the hallway. All five men stumbled to grab their briefcases and then headed off dejectedly, in search of another congressman to cajole.<br>The portly lobbyist hung back and tried to give it another shot. "Congressman, I've talked to my people in your district, and they've told me you have a lot of farmers waiting for the crop-failure money the president has in his budget." The lobbyist waited for a reaction from O'Rourke but got none. "If this budget doesn't pass, I wouldn't want to be in your shoes come next election."<br>O'Rourke looked at the man and pointed toward the door with his thumb. "I have work to do."<br>With the vote so close the lobbyist was not willing to give up easily. "Mr. O'Rourke, if you vote no on the president's budget, the American Farmers Association will be left with no other choice than to support your opponent next year."<br>O'Rourke shook his head and said, "Nice try, but I'm not running for a second term." Waving goodbye, the young congressman grabbed the door and closed it in the lobbyist's face. O'Rourke turned to face his secretary, Susan Chambers.<br>Susan smiled and said, "I'm sorry, Michael. I told them you had a full calendar, but they insisted on waiting around to see if you would fit them in."<br>"No apologies needed, Susan." Michael left the main reception area and walked into his office. He set his briefcase on the chair beside his desk and picked up a stack of pink messages. Yelling toward the door, he asked, "Has Tim come in yet?"<br>"No."<br>"Has he called?"<br>"Yes. He said that since there isn't a snowball's chance in hell of the president taking the funding for the Rural Electrification Administration out of the budget, he's going to get some errands done and be in around one." Tim O'Rourke was Michael's younger brother by two years and his chief of staff.<br>"I'm glad everyone is so positive around here."<br>Susan stood up from behind her desk and walked to the doorway of O'Rourke's office. "Michael, we're only being realists. I admire that you're trying to do what's right, but the problem is, guys like you don't win in Washington."<br>"Well, thank you for your vote of confidence, Susan."<br>Susan looked up into O'Rourke's bloodshot eyes. "Michael, were you out again last night?" O'Rourke nodded his head yes. "This bachelor life is going to kill you. Why don't you make an honest woman out of that adorable girlfriend of yours?"<br>O'Rourke had been hearing it from everyone lately, but he was in no position to get married. Maybe in another year...after he got out of Washington. He looked down and sighed, "Susan, I'm Irish, we tend to get married late in life. Besides, I'm not so sure she'll have me."<br>"That's a lie and you know it. She adores you. Take it from a woman: I've seen the way she looks at you with those big brown eyes. You're the one, so don't screw it up. There aren't too many like her out there." Chambers slapped him in the stomach. "I hope being crowned the most eligible bachelor in Washington hasn't gone to your head!"<br>O'Rourke frowned and shook his head. "Very funny, Susan."<br>Chambers turned and walked away, laughing.<br>"I'm glad you're getting such a kick out of this, Susan. Hold all of my calls. I have an appointment at noon, and until then I don't want to be disturbed."<br>"What if your grandfather or Liz calls?"<br>"No one, I don't want to be disturbed." O'Rourke shut the door and sat down behind his desk.<br><br>Copyright � 1997 by Vince Flynn</p><h2>Palace Pets 5-Minute Palace Pets Stories (5-Minute Stories)</h2><p>Meet Pumpkin, Berry, Treasure, Teacup, Bayou &amp; Blossom in this padded-cover treasury.

This fast-moving mystery, ably narrated by Peter Hermann, has an awful lot going on. Jack Morgan, head of a global private investigation firm called Private, is called upon to investigate the death of a friend&#39;s wife, plus the serial murders of more than a dozen high school girls. He&#39;s got more technology at his disposal than the CIA; furthermore, he&#39;s known to make his own rules--rules that allow him to indulge in a dose of revenge along with securing justice for the victims of crimes. Frankly, without Peter Hermann&#39;s quick-paced narration, this listener might have abandoned ship. But Hermann&#39;s perfect style and diction make this a quick and palatable listen.

But this book and the authors later Messianic Character of American Education were a resolute call to arms for Christians to get their children out of the pagan public schools and provide them with a genuine Christian education. Dr. Rushdoony had predicted that the humanist system, based on anti-Christian premises of the Enlightenment, could only get worse. Rushdoony was indeed a prophet. He knew that education divorced from God and from all transcendental standards would produce the educational disaster and moral barbarism we have today. The title of this book is particularly significant in that Dr. Rushdoony was able to identify the basic contradiction that pervades a secular society that rejects Gods sovereignty but still needs law and order, justice, science, and meaning to life. As Dr. Rushdoony writes, &#34;there is no law, no society, no justice, no structure, no design, no meaning apart from God.&#34; And so, modern man has become schizophrenic because of his rebellion against God.</p><p>Rushdoony is a well known American scholar, writer, and author of over thirty books. He holds B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of California and received his theological training at the Pacific School of Religion. An ordained minister, he has been a missionary among Paiute and Shoshone Indians as well as pastor of two California churches. He is founder of Chalcedon Foundation, an educational organization devoted to research, publishing, and cogent communication of a distinctively Christian scholarship to the world at large. He is currently engaged in research, lecturing, and assisting others in developing programs to put the Christian Faith into action.</p><h2>Desperation</h2><p>There's a place alone Interstate 50 that some call the loneliest place on Earth. It's not a very nice place to live. It's an even worse place to die. It's known as Desperation, Nevada...<br><br></p><p>A notice to those who feel that Stephen King has lost his magic touch: <i>Desperation</i> is the genuine goods. The ensemble cast of ordinary Americans thrown together by chance, including a disgruntled alcoholic writer and a child who is wise beyond his years, may be a bit too familiar. But the nearly deserted Nevada mining town with an enormous haunted mine pit and an abandoned movie theatre where the survivors hang out makes for a striking battleground, and the grisly action rarely flags. Best of all, though, are the characters of Tak, the ancient body-hopping evil who emerges from the mine, and of "God"--whom the <i>New York Times</i> describes as "the edgiest creation in <i>Desperation.</i> Remote, isolated, ironic, shrouded behind disguises, perhaps 'another legendary shadow,' this deity forms a sly foil, and an icy mirror, to Tak."Stephen King, the world&#39;s bestselling novelist, was educated at the University of Maine at Orono. He lives with his wife, the novelist Tabitha King, and their children in Bangor, Maine.</p><h2>Silly Sidney (Happy Times Adventures)</h2><p>Silly Sidney decides to keep fall from coming by putting the leaves back on the trees</p><p></p><h2>Preferring Christ : a Devotional Commentary and Workbook on the Rule of St. Benedict</h2><p>The Rule of St. Benedict continues to attract those who seek to live a deeper life, connected to Christ. But with such an ancient text, how can we authentically engage St. Benedict&#39;s Rule in a manner that is true to its profound insights-and to our own spiritual journey? Norvene Vest suggests that the answer lies in the way we read the Rule. &#34;It shouldn&#39;t be studied like a book of regulations, or a school textbook. It should be read as lectio divina.&#34; This profound yet very practical volume speaks to our urgent spiritual need. People yearn for an interior life deeply rooted in God, humanly balanced, and substantially founded in the Christian heritage. Vest offers a valuable resource by rendering much more accessible the spiritual wealth of the key text of the ancient Benedictine charism. Here is the solid, balanced wisdom that has nourished and guided innumerable Christians for nearly fifteen centuries.</p><p>Norvene Vest is a spiritual director, author, and workshop leader, especially known for her books on Benedictine spirituality for the common life.

Edgar Hoover Building. But Quinn's career -- and her life -- are about to change wildly. Testing a new program, Quinn's computer savvy turns up a mysterious DNA link among five gruesome murders. A link that the old FBI system had been carefully programmed to miss. A link that nearly costs Quinn her job, and soon, her life...Pitted against a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions, Quinn will match wits against powerful government forces that will use any means necessary to keep their dirty secrets hidden -- secrets that will land her in the clutches of a sadistic, brilliant madman who holds the key to it all.</p><p></p></p><p>Why would the FBI want to cover up a link between five unsolved murders, especially a link as telling as matching DNA recovered from every one of the crime scenes? That's the premise of Kyle Mills's <i>Burn Factor</i>. Instead of his usual hero, FBI agent Mark Beamon, the author introduces Quinn Barry, a relatively low-level analyst for the agency who stumbles across what at first looks like a glitch in the computer's forensics program. But of course it's not--the serial killer protected by the powers that be is a truly mad scientist who's indispensable to the completion of a top-secret weapons project. Quinn, whose lifelong ambition is to move up in the ranks and become a full-fledged FBI agent, is transferred out of her programming job as soon as she brings the link to the attention of superiors. But the plucky woman ignores their warnings and enlists the aid of another scientific genius, who also happens to be the chief suspect in at least one of the gruesome murders she's intent on solving. <p> <i>Burn Factor</i> is big on implausible and illogical plot twists, and small on characterizations. We never learn enough about Quinn to understand why she puts her career (not to mention her life) in jeopardy, even as evidence of a massive cover-up continues to mount and her boyfriend, a CIA agent, turns out to be a willing accomplice to the conspirator-in-chief. Fans of Mills's previous novels (<i>Rising Phoenix</i>, <i>Storming Heaven</i>, <i>Free Fall</i>) who keep waiting for Beamon to show up and save the day will be disappointed, especially since the author doesn't quite succeed in making Quinn Barry as appealing a protagonist. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>10 cds</p><h2>Best witness: The Mel Mermelstein affair and the triumph of historical revisionism</h2><p>Cutting through veritable mountains of misinformation and silence, this is the book that describes the little-known trial of Mel Mermelstein vs. the Institution for Historical Review and Libery Lobby. Working from a six-foot pile of sworn depositions, court filings and trial records, the author confronts the most untouchable issue of our day, the so-called &#34;Holocaust&#34; of six millions Jews by the Nazis. Neither the author, Michael Collins Piper, nor the IHR nor Liberty Lobby &#34;deny the Holocaust&#34;. But they know - as do all criminal investigators and millions of murder mystery fans - that the truth is in the details&#34;. And to get at the truth of the holocaust, allegedly the greatest crime of history, the details have to be known. The trial of the IHR and Liberty Lobby became the trial of Mel Mermelstein, as the reader will see. The book contains only a fraction of the whole truth about the holocaust but it is important for that reason. As it turned out, Mel Mermelstein, the self-described &#34;best witness&#34; to the holocaust, with the aid of five law firms, the entire press of the world and a Jewish judge, came out a bad loser against two institutions with no Establishment support whatsoever and the hostility of the press. The book will be revelation to most readers and a bitter pill to many who may have forgotten that in America those who debunk sacred cows have rights as well as those who worship them.</p><p>The author is a correspondent for The Spotlight.

No city was more fervently attached to slavery, and no city was seen by the North as a greater threat to the bonds barely holding together the Union. And so, with Abraham Lincoln's election looming, Charleston's leaders faced a climactic decision: they could submit to abolition--or they could drive South Carolina out of the Union and hope that the rest of the South would follow.<br><i>In Madness Rules the Hour</i>, Paul Starobin tells the story of how Charleston succumbed to a fever for war and charts the contagion's relentless progress and bizarre turns. In doing so, he examines the wily propagandists, the ambitious politicians, the gentlemen merchants and their wives and daughters, the compliant pastors, and the white workingmen who waged a violent and exuberant revolution in the name of slavery and Southern independence. They devoured the <i>Mercury</i>, the incendiary newspaper run by a fanatical father and son; made holy the deceased John C. Calhoun; and adopted "Le Marseillaise" as a rebellious anthem. <i>Madness Rules the Hour</i> is a portrait of a culture in crisis and an insightful investigation into the folly that fractured the Union and started the Civil War.</p><p><b>Paul Starobin</b> has been a frequent contributor to the <i>Atlantic</i> and the <i>New Republic</i> and is a former Moscow bureau chief for <i>Business Week</i>.

Recommended for those interested in the Civil War and its causes.&#x2015;<b><i><b>Library Journal</b></i></b><br><br>"Charleston in 1860 was a lovely, civilized, gracious city poisoned by tribalism, conspiracy theories, and the evil of slavery. With a clear, sharp eye, Starobin takes us back to this strange time and place and tells a riveting, tragic story."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Evan Thomas, author of <i>Being Nixon</i></b></i></b><br><br>"'South Carolina is too small for a Republic,' wrote James Petigru in 1860, 'but too large for an insane asylum.' Starobin has skillfully chronicled the mass psychology in favor of secession that built to a climax after Lincoln's election and led the state out of the Union."&#x2015;<b><i><b>James M. McPherson, author of Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>Battle Cry of Freedom</i></b></i></b><br><br>"As the birthplace of disunion and the cradle of rebellion, the city of Charleston long claimed a perverse, myth-encrusted pride in launching a noble 'revolution' against 'Northern aggression'and federal overreach. Starobin has exploded this magnolia-suffused legend by convincingly portraying Charleston as a cauldron of disloyalty, extremism, and vicious white supremacy. Boasting fresh research and riveting characters, this vivid account of the feverish run-up to the Civil War sets the record straight with panache. The book should take its place as the definitive account of the hysteria that nearly destroyed, but in the end transformed, the United States."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Harold Holzer, winner of the Lincoln Prize</b></i></b><br><br>"This book is a gem-a tightly written account of Southern 'war fever' in Charleston during the fateful year of 1860.

Starobin's rich, sweeping portrait of a city and its people on the brink brings us as close as possible to those frightful, red-hot passions of that fateful time.

Insulin helps the body transform food into energy and regulate blood sugar levels. When we eat carbohydrates, the body breaks them down into sugar (glucose) to be used as energy. If you have more glucose than your body needs, your body will respond by producing more insulin: the insulin will stabilize your blood sugar level by storing the excess glucose as fat, and this means weight gain. This process is accelerated in people with insulin resistance because they have higher baseline levels of insulin.</p> <p>So, is the solution to insulin resistance omitting carbohydrates from our diet?

Shortly after her husband&#x2019;s death, Blackburn became fascinated with Doggerland, the stretch of land that once connected Great Britain to Continental Europe but is now subsumed by the North Sea. She was driven to explore the lives of the people who lived there&#x2014;studying its fossil record, as well as human artifacts that have been unearthed near the area.<br><br>In <i>Time Song,</i> Blackburn brings us along on her journey to discover what Doggerland left behind, introducing us to the paleontologists, archaeologists, fishermen and fellow Doggerland enthusiasts she meets along the way. She sees the footprints of early humans fossilized in the soft mud of an estuary alongside the scattered pockmarks made by rain falling eight thousand years ago. She visits a cave where the remnants of a Neanderthal meal have turned to stone. In Denmark she sits beside Tollund Man, who seems to be about to wake from a dream, even though he had lain in a peat bog since the start of the Iron Age. As Doggerland begins to come into focus, what emerges is a profound meditation on time, a sense of infinity as going backward and an intimation of the immensity of everything that has already passed through its time on earth and disappeared.</p><p><b>JULIA BLACKBURN</b> is the author of ten books of nonfiction, including <i>The Three of Us, Old Man Goya </i>(a National Book Critics Circle Award finalist) and <i>With Billie </i>(winner of&nbsp;the ASCAP Deems Taylor Award).

She lives in England.&#x2018;Oh,&#x2019; I say casually, as if in answer to a question, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m writing about a country called Doggerland. It&#x2019;s also known as North Sea Land because that&#x2019;s where it was, under what is now the North Sea. It emerged after the last Ice Age and with the warming of the climate it became a wonderfully fertile place of rivers and lakes, gently rounded hills and sheltered valleys, reed beds and salt marshes in the lowlands, trees on higher ground and a profusion of life: fish, birds, animals and humans as well. These were a people who left few traces of their passing. They hunted with weapons made from wood, bone or stone; they had canoes cut from the trunks of trees; they had dogs working with them and sometimes buried their dead alongside their dogs. But as the ice went on melting the sea levels rose dramatically &#x2013; you can&#x2019;t believe how fast, it could be more than two metres within a century &#x2013; so the land was inundated, familiar places submerged or made inaccessible. Seven thousand years ago, Doggerbank was still there as an island and then it too was gone. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;And,&#x2019; I continue, carried forward by the idea of it all, &#x2018;I am also writing about what happened in this same area long before the last Ice Age. I go back to the first humans who were here, close to where I live: a cache of worked flints was found quite recently near a holiday camp and then a bit further up the coast there is the little flurry of footsteps fossilised in what was once the soft mud of a river estuary. Five people pottering about some nine hundred thousand years ago; they were probably collecting plants and shellfish. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Mammoth,&#x2019; I say, &#x2018;great herds of them moving across the grassy steppes when Britain was part of the Eurasian land mass. I&#x2019;ve collected quite a lot of mammoth bones, along with those of other extinct creatures; it&#x2019;s best to go looking after a storm has scoured the edges of the cliffs to reveal whatever secrets they have been hiding, but I often forget to go then. I did pick up a lovely stone axehead just recently. It looks like nothing much until you hold it in your hand and feel how well it fits, how sharp it is. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;Of course I ask myself what on earth I think I&#x2019;m doing, rattling around like a ghost in such distant landscapes of the past, and this is what might be the answer, or at least part of the answer. I am not especially afraid of my own death, but I am afraid of the death of forests and oceans, the contamination of water and air, the sense that we are heading towards a catastrophe from which there will be no escape. I comfort myself with the knowledge that this is nothing new: the climate has often shifted from extremes of heat to extremes of cold; oceans rising to cover the land and shrinking to reveal it in a different form; living creatures emerging in all their strangeness and determination to survive and some of them manage to hold on, but others do not. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;I wonder now if it makes more sense to imagine infinity going backwards in time, rather than forwards. When you look at it that way round, you no longer have the vague dread of what the future holds, instead there is the intimation of the enormity of everything that has gone before: a solemn procession of life in all its myriad forms moving steadily towards this present moment. You can almost hear the songs they are singing. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;There is something else. My husband died a few years ago. He has vanished and yet he remains close, beneath the surface as it were, so perhaps I am also trying to catch a glimpse of him within the great jumble of everything else that has been lost from our sight.&#x2019;</p><h2>Iron Kingdoms RPG Core Rules</h2><p><b>Iron Kingdoms Full Metal Fantasy Roleplaying Game: Core Rules</b><br><br>�<b>Package Info:</b><br>-Product is for use in the Iron Kingdoms table top game<br>-Models are supplied unpainted, and require assembly<br>-Any scenery shown, paint, or glue is not included<br><br><b> Iron Kingdoms Products by Privateer Press.</b></p><p></p><h2>The Apex Treasury of Underground Comics / The Best of Bijou Funnies</h2><p>Various underground comics from the 1960s and 1970s from Bijou</p><p></p><h2>The Last Wolf of Ireland</h2><p>In Ireland in the 1780s, a young boy and girl who find a wolf&#39;s den in the forest vow to protect the animals from the superstitious townspeople and the greed of the hunters.</p><p>No BioFriends Devin O'Hara and Katey Sullivan know they must hide the three wolflings they have discovered, for Squire Watson has vowed to shoot every wolf in Ireland.

In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez (developer of The Gonzalez Protocol for the treatment of cancer and many other degenerative diseases) explains the importance of nutrition in maintaining and restoring the autonomic nervous system balance that is so crucial to good health. He describes how individual variation in nervous system function means that different individuals require different types of diets (ranging from largely raw food and vegetarian to diets high in fatty red meat, and every variation in between) in order to achieve good health. Drawing upon more than twenty-five years of private practice in New York, and prior research by Drs. Pottenger, Gellhorn, and Kelley, he also explains why nutritional supplementation protocols similarly need to be individualized for optimal autonomic nervous system function. While this book is not a how-to manual, reading it will help you better understand how to maintain or improve your own health-or, if you are a health professional, to better assist your patients to remain healthy or recover from illness-without potentially harmful medications. Discover the secret of how different nutrients regulate the nervous system. Have you ever wondered why "one size fits all" diets don't work for everyone? We are all unique individuals. Learn how a personalized diet and nutritional supplement program promotes good health by balancing the functions of the autonomic nervous system. In addition to winning the 2018 Book Excellence Award in the "Diet &amp; Nutrition" category, this book was a Finalist in the "Health: Diet &amp; Exercise" category of the 2017 BEST BOOK AWARDS.</p><p></p><h2>The Tarnished Door: The New Immigrants and the Transformation of America</h2><p>Looks at the world of illegal aliens residing in the United States and explores topics including the chaos, inadequacy, and corruption of American immigration policy and service</p><p></p><h2>Christianity as a Mystical Fact</h2><p>Christianity as Mystical Fact, and the Mysteries of Antiquity was the title given by the author to this religious study, when, eight years ago, he gathered into it the substance of lectures delivered by him in 1902. The title indicated the special character of the book.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland. <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p></p><h2>The Biblical Period from Abraham to Ezra: An Historical Survey</h2><p>Contents include: Hebrew Beginnings, The Age of Moses, The Conquest of Palestine, Tribal Rule and Charismatic Leaders, The United Monarchy, From the Disruption of the Monarchy to the Revolt of Jehu, From Jehu to the Fall of Samaria to the Captivity, Captivity and Restoration, From Nehemiah to the Fall of the Persian Empire.

Ellison went on to earn many other honors, including two presidential medals and election to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, but his failure to publish a second novel, despite years of striving, haunted him for the rest of his life. Now, as the first scholar given complete access to Ellison&#x2019;s papers, Arnold Rampersad has written not only a reliable account of the main events of Ellison&#x2019;s life but also a complex, authoritative portrait of an unusual artist and human being.<br><br>Born poor and soon fatherless in 1913, Ralph struggled both to belong to and to escape from the world of his childhood. We learn here about his sometimes happy, sometimes harrowing years growing up in Oklahoma City and attending Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Arriving in New York in 1936, he became a political radical before finally embracing the cosmopolitan intellectualism that would characterize his dazzling cultural essays, his eloquent interviews, and his historic novel. The second half of his long life brought both widespread critical acclaim and bitter disputes with many opponents, including black cultural nationalists outraged by what they saw as his elitism and misguided pride in his American citizenship. <br><br>This biography describes a man of magnetic personality who counted Saul Bellow, Langston Hughes, Robert Penn Warren, Richard Wright, Richard Wilbur, Albert Murray, and John Cheever among his closest friends; a man both admired and reviled, whose life and art were shaped mainly by his unyielding desire to produce magnificent art and by his resilient faith in the moral and cultural strength of America.<br><br>A magisterial biography of Ralph Waldo Ellison&#x2014;a revelation of the man, the writer, and his times.</p><p>On the strength of just one novel, as well as a series of lasting essays in cultural criticism, Ralph Ellison stands as one of the major literary figures of the last century. The novel, of course, is <i>Invisible Man</i>, and much of the drama of Ellison's life, as told by Arnold Rampersad in the first major biography of Ellison, is twofold: how Ellison came to write his masterwork, and how he failed to write another. Given complete access to Ellison's papers, Rampersad tells the story of Ellison's long apprenticeship as a musician and writer and his long life, full of honors and frustrations, after the great success of <i>Invisible Man</i>, capturing the complexities, to use of one of Ellison's favorite words, of his elusive subject, at once passionate and patrician, fiercely critical of his country's racial divisions and stubbornly hopeful about its democratic possibilities. <p> <strong>Questions for Arnold Rampersad</strong> </p><p> One of the leading scholars of African American literature and the author of major biographies of Langston Hughes and Jackie Robinson, Arnold Rampersad is an ideal biographer for one of the great figures of 20th-century American writing. We asked him a few questions about Ralph Ellison. </p><p> <strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Ralph Ellison came from Oklahoma--the "Territory," as he liked to call it--and in his essays he wrote evocatively of the conditions there that nurtured his creative life (although he rarely returned as an adult). What was Oklahoma like for an ambitious but poor young African American like him? </p><p><strong>Rampersad:</strong> Ellison, who spent the first 20 years of his life in Oklahoma, was intensely aware of the pioneers, white and black, who had migrated toward the end of the 19th century, from the South especially, into what had been demarcated as "Indian" territory. These pioneers had come first as homesteaders, then as founders of the state of Oklahoma in 1907, six years before Ralph's birth. For the rest of his life he carried with him a keen, precious sense of Oklahoma as an extraordinary American site, one that captured much of the complexity of America as it had been shaped by frontier life. Oklahoma City meant excellent jazz and the blues--black culture in its artistic exuberance--as in the pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian (who played later with Benny Goodman) and the equally famous blues singer Jimmie Rushing. But Ellison also knew Oklahoma as a place where Jim Crow was a disturbing, often ruinous force. Moreover, his father had died there when Ralph was only three, and the result was that his mother was forced to toil in humble jobs that sorely embarrassed a proud boy. </p><p> Later overlooking the slights and snubs he experienced as a youth, and dwelling especially on his various friendships with fellow students at the local "colored" schools, Ellison cherished his memory of Oklahoma as a region of almost mythic proportion and magical charm. He took immense pleasure in going back home--but he went home only after he had become famous and could command the respect and attention he had craved in his bittersweet youth. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> Ellison spent a long and varied creative apprenticeship before writing <i>Invisible Man</i>. What did he learn along the way that allowed him to make such a stunning debut? </p><p><strong>Rampersad:</strong> Ellison's many years of training as a musician (on the trumpet) as a youth served him in good stead when he committed himself (influenced first by his friends Langston Hughes and Richard Wright) around 1937 to become a writer. He was then 24 years old--pretty late as a start for most important fiction writers, but not too late for a man of enormous drive, wide reading, and restless intelligence. As Ellison served his apprenticeship, he kept his major literary masters close at hand. They were Dostoyevsky for his distillation of the turbulence, vitality, and tragic gloom of Russia in the 19th century; Hemingway for his terse, virile elegance; Richard Wright (although the competitive Ellison would play down his influence) for the gritty American realism that sought to expose and redress American social injustice; Andre Malraux, for combining in an often breathtaking way the life of radical action and the life of the mind; and in some ways above all, T.S. Eliot, whose landmark poem of 1922 <i>The Waste Land</i> encouraged Ellison in his mature commitment to modernism, a pervasive if mild surrealism, jazzy improvisation, and cosmopolitan learning. </p><p> Ellison was a sometimes crudely Marxist writer until about 1942, when he began a zealous conversion away from the literary and political left. Three years later, he started <i>Invisible Man</i>. By that time, after years of hard work as a reader and a consciously apprentice writer, he was fully committed to an esthetic based in liberal humanism, with a particular passion for explorations of American literature and culture. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> The great question with Ellison is, of course, what happened after <i>Invisible Man</i>? Why do you think he struggled so with his second novel? </p><p><strong>Rampersad:</strong> In some ways, the winning of the National Book Award in 1953 for <i>Invisible Man</i>, and not the mere publication of the novel itself, transformed Ellison's life for better and for worse. This prominent award to a young black man (who beat out Hemingway for the prize) set in motion a flood of honors, big responsibilities, and financial rewards. These tokens of professional success steadily combined with Ellison's proud perfectionism to make it increasingly hard for him to offer the world anything less than a work conceived and executed on a scale that reached grand--perhaps impossibly grand--heights of excellence. Committed to a literature of myth, symbol, and surrealism, instead of the literature of everyday life, he found himself often entangled in fiction writing that drew on techniques borrowed from James Joyce and on Faulknerian myths and fables about race, miscegenation, social injustice, and American culture. He also prized improvisation, which called for powers of organization and discipline that proved finally to be beyond him as a novelist. And he was not helped by his principled refusal to allow himself to be comfortable with the many African Americans who were attracted, starting in the 1960s, by black cultural nationalism and black power. Although he believed in African American culture, he became increasingly and painfully isolated in ways that led him away from the completion of vivid fiction set largely in that culture. He liked to blame his writing problems on the fire in 1967 that destroyed his country home in Massachusetts, but the facts about the fire do not support this claim. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> You've written major biographies of Langston Hughes and Jackie Robinson as well. How did Ellison's public path through the mid-century compare to theirs? </p><p><strong>Rampersad:</strong> Langston Hughes was the polar opposite of Ralph Ellison in many ways. Hughes loved the masses of black Americans unconditionally; he believed in world travel and in varieties of friendship that covered almost the entire social spectrum; he was almost compulsive in his desire to help younger artists, especially younger black artists; he wrote consistently in a variety of forms of which poetry, drama, and fiction were only the most conspicuous; he also cared little for esoteric art and Olympian esthetic standards. </p><p> Ellison was a different man. He traveled little; guarded his resources zealously and believed that young writers should make their way by their individual efforts as he believed he had done for himself; he didn't hesitate to criticize black leaders when he thought they were abusing their authority, which was often, as far as he was concerned; and he set the highest esthetic standards for himself and others. He stuck to writing fiction and essays, and his total output is dwarfed by that of Langston Hughes--except, Ellison would say proudly, in terms of quality. Hughes paid, in the 1930s and through the 40s and early 50s, for his once deep attachment to radical socialism; Ellison quietly shed similar attachments in the name of a complex patriotism. In doing so, he escaped the rough treatment meted out to Hughes and others. </p><p> Jackie Robinson was by far the most famous of the three, and no doubt had the greatest impact, as a force for desegregation, on American culture. While he was not an artist or intellectual, he was drawn to politics especially after the end of his baseball career. He was a moderate Republican; the others were Democrats, although Hughes was more critical of party politics than was Ellison, who was befriended and advanced by President Johnson. Both Johnson and, later, Ronald Reagan awarded Ellison the prestigious Presidential Medal of the Arts. </p><p><strong>Amazon.com:</strong> <i>Invisible Man</i> is one of only a few novels from its era that has kept its power and popularity for readers in later generations. Has it had a similar influence on younger writers? Ellison's prickly relations with his successors may have discouraged immediate followers, but can you see his influence today? </p><p><strong>Rampersad:</strong> Young writers today, black as well as white, have many sources to draw on and many beacons of inspiration to guide them. And yet <i>Invisible Man</i> is in many ways as admirable, fascinating, and complex today as when it was first published. Among novels by black Americans, its only true rival in terms of quality of craft might be Morrison's <i>Beloved</i>, and the wide range of effects in Ellison's novel is probably unmatched by any other black novelist. Ellison, we should remember, set out consciously to write a novel that was simultaneously about a black man and about an Everyman who transcended race, and to a surprising extent he succeeded in doing so. His novel continues to appeal to blacks and whites alike, and especially to men. Moreover, in writing so brilliantly about race, which remains and probably will remain the most challenging topic in American culture, he practically guaranteed the continuing resonance of <i>Invisible Man</i>. </p><p> The superiority of <i>Shadow and Act</i>, his 1964 collection of essays and interviews, to virtually every other book on the subject of black art and culture is evident. Its only serious rival in this respect is probably Du Bois's <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> (1903). But <i>Shadow and Act</i> lives while much, although not all, of Du Bois's classic book is dated. <i>Shadow and Act</i> continues to serve as a primer for younger black writers who are seriously interested in questions of literary craft and race in America. </p>Arnold Rampersad<b> </b>is Sara Hart Kimball Professor in the Humanities and a member of the Department of English at Stanford University.

So totally was he the master of this medium, his windows surpassed, in both quality and quantity, any that had preceded them. Yet today most Tiffany windows have never been seen by the public, and until now, no book on the subject has ever been published. Alastair Duncan has tracked down virtually every window still extant, has documented examples that have disappeared or been destroyed, and has provided magnificent photographs, the great majority of them taken specially for this book. Tiffany Windows provides not only superb photographs of over 200 windows -- more than half in breathtaking color -- but a comprehensive text that examines how the glass was made and the windows constructed; Tiffany&#39;s designers and the workings of the Window Department; his critics and international exhibitions; window themes; signatures; chronology; and a complete list of all known Tiffany windows. For the Tiffany enthusiast or collector, this book is definitive and indispensable; for anyone who has ever gasped at the beauty of a Tiffany floral or landscape window, the book is a treasure.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>A Year In My Kitchen: Recipes Inspired by the Seasons and Based on a Culinary Toolbox of Inventive Flavorings [A Cookbook]</h2><p><p>Award-winning chef Skye Gyngell passionately believes that cooking is an intuitive, imaginative practice, one that reflects the changing seasons and relies on the choicest fresh produce. <i>A Year in My Kitchen</i> is a charming culinary tribute to her favorite seasonal ingredients: tender herbs, vibrant fruits, and earthy root vegetables that are all the more exceptional when we enjoy them at their peak. <br>&nbsp;<br>The head chef at London&#x2019;s acclaimed Petersham Nurseries Caf�, Gyngell relies on a toolbox of simple recipes, techniques, and flavorings that she combines with an infinite variety of ingredients. <i>A Year in My Kitchen</i> begins by exploring the fundamentals of that toolbox by presenting recipes for infused oils, vinaigrettes, and roasted spice mix, all of which can be used to enhance the rest of the produce-driven recipes.

Marshaling all the skills and energy that propelled his history-making Pulitzer Prize reporting on Watergate, Bernstein gives us the most detailed, sophisticated, comprehensive, and revealing account we have had of the complex human being and political meteor who has already helped define one presidency and may well become, herself, the woman in charge of another.<br><br>We see the shaping of Hillary as a self-described &#x201c;mind conservative and heart liberal&#x201d; &#x2014;her ostensibly idyllic Midwestern girlhood (her mother a nurturer, but her father a disciplinarian, harsher than she has acknowledged); her early development of deep religious feelings; her curiosity fueled by dedicated teachers, by exposure to Martin Luther King Jr., by the ferment of the sixties, and, above all, by a desire to change the world. At Wellesley, we watch Hillary, a Republican turned Democrat, thriving in the new sky&#x2019;s-the-limit freedom for women, already perceived as a spokeswoman for her generation, her commencement speech celebrated in <i>Life </i>magazine. And the book takes us to Yale Law School as Hillary meets and falls in love with Bill Clinton and cancels her dream to go her own way, to New York or Washington, tying her fortune, instead, to his in Arkansas.<br><br>Bernstein clarifies the often amazing dynamic of their marriage, shows us the extent to which Hillary has been instrumental in the triumphs and troubles of Bill Clinton&#x2019;s governorship and presidency, and sheds light on her own political brilliance and her blind spots&#x2014;especially her suspicion and mishandling of the press and her overt hostility to the opposition that clouded her entry into the capital. He untangles her relationship to Whitewater, Troopergate, and Travelgate. He leads us to understand the failure of her health care initiative.<br><br>In the emotional and political chaos of the Lewinsky affair we see Hillary, despite her immense hurt and anger, standing by her husband&#x2014;evoking a rising wave of sympathy from a public previously cool to her. It helps carry her into the Senate, where she applies the political lessons she has learned. It is now <i>her </i>time. As she decides to run for president, her husband now <i>her </i>valued aide, she has one more chance to fulfill her ambition for herself&#x2014;to change the world.<br><br>In his preparation for <i>A Woman in Charge, </i>Bernstein reexamined everything pertinent written about and by Hillary Clinton. He interviewed some two hundred of her colleagues, friends, and enemies and was allowed unique access to the candid record of the 1992 presidential campaign kept by Hillary&#x2019;s best friend, Diane Blair.<br><br>He has given us a book that enables us, at last, to address the questions Americans are insistently&#x2014;even obsessively&#x2014;asking about Hillary Clinton: What is her character?

Drawing on over 200 interviews with Clinton associates (both colleagues and adversaries), as well as major pieces written by and about the former First Lady, Bernstein has constructed an indelible portrait of perhaps the most polarizing figure in American politics, from her midwestern roots to her own presidential ambitions; but don't take our word for it--read an excerpt from the first chapter and decide for yourself. <p> </p><p></p> <b>Excerpt. � Reprinted by permission. All rights reserved.<br> Chapter One: Formation</b> <p></p><i> I adored [my father] when I was a little girl. I would eagerly watch for him from a window and run down the street to meet him on his way home after work. With his encouragement and coaching, I played baseball, football and basketball. I tried to bring home good grades to win his approval.<br> &#x2013;Living History</i> <p></p> Hillary Rodham&#x2019;s childhood was not the suburban idyll suggested by the shaded front porch and gently sloping lawn of what was once the family home at 235 Wisner Street in Park Ridge, Illinois. In this leafy environment of postwar promise and prosperity, the Rodhams were distinctly a family of odd ducks, isolated from their neighbors by the difficult character of her father, Hugh Rodham, a sour, unfulfilled man whose children suffered his relentless, demeaning sarcasm and misanthropic inclination, endured his embarrassing parsimony, and silently accepted his humiliation and verbal abuse of their mother. <p></p> Yet as harsh, provocative, and abusive as Rodham was, he and his wife, the former Dorothy Howell, imparted to their children a pervasive sense of family and love for one another that in Hillary&#x2019;s case is of singular importance. When Bill Clinton and Hillary honeymooned in Acapulco in 1975, her parents and her two brothers, Hughie (Hugh Jr.) and Tony, stayed in the same hotel as the bride and groom. <p></p> Dorothy and Hugh Rodham, despite the debilitating pathology and undertow of tension in their marriage (discerned readily by visitors to their home), were assertive parents who, at mid-century, intended to convey to their children an inheritance secured by old-fashioned values and verities. They believed (and preached, in their different traditions) that with discipline, hard work, encouragement (often delivered in an unconventional manner), and enough education at home, school, and church, a child could pursue almost any dream. In the case of their only daughter, Hillary Diane, born October 26, 1947, this would pay enormous dividends, sending her into the world beyond Park Ridge with a steadiness and sense of purpose that eluded her two younger brothers. But it came at a price: Hugh imposed a patriarchal unpleasantness and ritual authoritarianism on his household, mitigated only by the distinctly modern notion that Hillary would not be limited in opportunity or skills by the fact that she was a girl. <p></p> Hugh Rodham, the son of Welsh immigrants, was sullen, tight-fisted, contrarian, and given to exaggeration about his own accomplishments. Appearances of a sort were important to him: he always drove a new Lincoln or Cadillac. But he wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to spit tobacco juice through an open window. He chewed his cud habitually, voted a straight Republican ticket, and was infuriatingly slow to praise his children. "He was rougher than a corncob and gruff as could be," an acquaintance once said. Nurturance and praise were left largely to his wife, whose intelligence and abilities he mocked and whose gentler nature he often trampled. "Don&#x2019;t let the doorknob hit you in the ass on your way out," he frequently said at the dinner table when she&#x2019;d get angry and threaten to leave. She never left, but some friends and relatives were perplexed at Dorothy&#x2019;s decision to stay married when her husband&#x2019;s abuse seemed so unbearable. <p></p> "She would never say, That&#x2019;s it. I&#x2019;ve had it," said Betsy Ebeling,* Hillary&#x2019;s closest childhood friend, who witnessed many contentious scenes at the Rodham dinner table. Sometimes the doorknob remark would break the tension and everybody would laugh. But not always. By the time Hillary had reached her teens, her father seemed defined by his mean edges&#x2013;he had almost no recognizable enthusiasms or pretense to lightness as he descended into continuous bullying, ill-humor, complaint, and dejection. <br><br> <br><br>Carl Bernstein shared a Pulitzer Prize with Bob Woodward for his coverage of Watergate for <i>The</i> <i>Washington Post. </i>He is the author, with Woodward, of <i>All the President&#x2019;s Men </i>and <i>The Final Days,</i> and, with Marco Politi, of <i>His Holiness:</i> <i>John Paul II and the History of Our Time. </i>He is also the author of <i>Loyalties, </i>a memoir about his parents during McCarthy&#x2013;era Washington.

From stories of her youth during World War II -- when Decter and her friends learned that "only the class beauty and the class tramp had no difficulty with the dating system" -- to a surprising and often hilarious picture of what the 1950s were really like to an account of her later roles as a single mother, publishing executive, happily married woman, political iconoclast, and doting grandmother, Decter paints a singular portrait of a life lived on the front lines of American culture.</p><p>By turns serious, wry, and deeply personal, <em>An Old Wife's Tale</em> brings us an important new perspective on twentieth-century American life.</p></p><p><p>Midge Decter is an author and editor whose essays and reviews have appeared in <em>Harper's, The Atlantic, National Review, The New Republic, </em>and <em>The Weekly Standard.</em> A regular contributor to <em>Commentary,</em> she is also the author of several books, the most recent being <em>An Old Wife's Tale.</em> She is a member of the board of the Heritage Foundation, the Center for Security Policy, First Things magazine of the Institute on Religion and Public Life, and the Clare Boothe Luce Fund, and she lectures widely on a variety of subjects, from the family to foreign policy. She lives in New York City with her husband, author Norman Podhoretz.</p>Under cover of a memoir, Decter, a politically conservative columnist and author (Liberal Parents, Radical Children), has a lot of fun railing at two of her favorite targets: feminists and communists. A right wing fixture in many debates with feminists (whom she refers to as "libbers") in the 1970s, she still can't figure out what possible complaint women could harbor against their position in society. Although she obviously enjoyed working in the literary field while raising children, the former executive editor of Harper's now wishes she had waited until her youngest was in high school. In addition to swipes at Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and lesbians at large, she also ventures the unpopular opinion that housework is "nourishing" and blames the 1960s and '70s women's movement for self-destructive trends, such as anorexia, that afflict girls today. Her hostility toward communists led Decter to form the Committee for a Free World (now disbanded), composed of conservative thinkers, to provide journalistic support for worldwide economic and political freedom. The ideological rants in this very readable and occasionally witty account will be of great interest to many conservative readers, but Decter's personal, less caustic recollections, especially those about her four children, 10 grandchildren and longtime husband, Norman Podhoretz (also a prominent conservative intellectual), have a wider appeal.

To commemorate the 40th anniversary of their beginning, with Master and Commander, these evocative stories are being re-issued in paperback with smart new livery. This is the twelfth book in the series. Jack Aubrey is a naval officer, a post-captain of experience and capacity. When The Letter of Marque opens he has been struck off the Navy List for a crime he has not committed. With Aubrey is his friend and ship&#39;s surgeon Stephen Maturin, who is also an unofficial British intelligence agent. Maturin has bought for Aubrey his old ship the Surprise, so that the misery of ejection from the service can be palliated by the command of what Aubrey calls a &#39;private man-of-war&#39; -- a letter of marque, a privateer. Together they sail on a voyage which, if successful, might restore Aubrey to the rank, and the raison d&#39;etre, whose loss he so much regrets. Around these simple, ostensibly familar elements Patrick O&#39;Brian has written a novel of great narrative power, exploring his extraordinary world once more, in a tale full of human feeling and rarely matched in its drama.</p><p>When Jack Aubrey is unfairly deprived of his commission in the Royal Navy, Stephen Maturin comes to the rescue, purchasing the captain's former ship and outfitting it as a privateer, to be commanded by...Jack Aubrey.

Paying meticulous attention to the evolving rhythm and syntax of speech, and their alliance with class and race, Womack demonstrates that woven into the mutable nature of language are clues to the dark and shifting potentials for the future of the society in which we live.</p><h2>Uncanny Avengers 2: The Apocalypse Twins (Marvel Now)</h2><p>The future begins in the past!

Remender served as writer on hit video games Dead Space and Bulletstorm, while providing art for punk/metal bands like NOFX and 3 Inches of Blood. He's co-created many popular independent titles, including the critically acclaimed Fear Agent with longtime collaborators Tony Moore and Jerome Ope�a. His time at Marvel started on Punisher and has since led to well-received runs on Uncanny X-Force and Venom.<br><br>Spanish illustrator Daniel Acu�a began his professional career with the publication of the French series Claus and Simon, later reprinted by the popular American magazine Heavy Metal. Acu�a then burst on to the American comics scene with DC's Green Lantern and Flash. For Marvel, he has illustrated such popular series as Young X-Men, Eternals, Black Widow, X-Men Legacy, Avengers, New Avengers and Wolverine.Beginning with a cracking-good flashback story featuring Thor&#x2019;s encounter with X-Men nemesis Apocalypse and exploding into a plot involving time-lord Kang&#x2019;s manipulation of the Apocalypse Twins and the slaying of godlike Celestial, Marvel presents the second volume featuring a team made of two of its hottest cinematic properties, the Avengers and the X-Men. The scope is ratcheted up to a cosmic level, which, along with a growing cast and a story that breaks off in the middle, will give experienced readers a lot to contend with and newcomers virtually no entry point at all. However, Remender does not do this at the expense of character, creating a sense of dire tension among the team and giving everyone in the large ensemble fine moments, particularly Thor, who feels responsible for letting a vastly powerful weapon fall into enemy hands, and Wolverine, plagued with guilt over the death of his son. Acuna takes over the art chores impressively, giving the space gods and superhumans a luster and wonder that even movies still can&#x2019;t quite match. --Jesse Karp</p><h2>A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern/Central North America (Peterson Field Guide Series)</h2><p>The first edition was published in 1958, the second in 1975.

Really? How about a vampire novel about single motherhood? And Otis Redding? And best friends? And how you choose whom you kill? And what that costs? And whether there&#39;s ever a way back? On a rare night out in Charlotte, North Carolina, Natalie and Sophie best friends, single moms, music lovers meet the Whistler at the Back Way Out. In the aftermath of that encounter, desperate to save their children and, just maybe, themselves, they flee together down the back roads of the Deep South, pursued by guilt, the Whistler and his Mother, and their own growing, terrible hunger. Bloody, sexy, rollicking, and sad, MOTHERLESS CHILD is a road novel about finding a way back to a home that no longer exists, a paean to music that drives us out of ourselves, a howling joyride toward heartbreak, and just maybe the vampire novel you really haven&#39;t yet read: the human one.</p><p>Glen Hirshberg is the author of two novels, THE SNOWMAN&#39;S CHILDREN and THE BOOK OF BUNK, and three collections of stories. Among his prizes and honors are three International Horror Guild Awards--two for Best Collection--and a Shirley Jackson Award. With Dennis Etchison and Peter Atkins, he co-founded the Rolling Darkness Revue, a traveling ghost story performance troupe that tours the west coast of the United States each fall. He lives in the Los Angeles area with his wife and children.<p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>She met him on a Monday. Her heart stood still. At the time, she was sure his did, too. Of course she turned out to be right about that.</p> <p>The place was called the Back Way Out, a uniquely Charlotte sort of shithole, tricked out like a real juke joint with crooked shingles hammered over the drywall and sawdust shavings scattered across the stain-resistant vinyl-and-tile flooring. The Gimmick, even more than the d�cor, gave the bar away as the young-banker haven it was: everyone who entered got a laminated, folding yellow card, with a clip-art sketch of a beer mug on it and eighty-seven tiny squares. Fill each square by drinking&#x2014;or at least ordering&#x2014;all eighty-seven varieties of microbrew the bar served and you became a Back Way Out legend and got your photo on the Crossroads Wall behind the stage. Fill forty-three squares and you got a yellow Halfway Out the Back T-shirt, complete with drooling smiley-face logo.</p> <p>Natalie considered it a small sign of hope for humanity that she saw at least half a dozen drooling smiley-face T-shirts as Sophie dragged her through the door, but no new photos on the Crossroads Wall. The last time they&#x2019;d come, eighteen months before, there&#x2019;d been the same three grinning frat-boy idiots up there, in matching oversized Hornets jerseys. Eighteen months, Natalie found herself wondering. Was that really all? It seemed so much longer. Way back in their old lives. Back when they&#x2019;d had lives. Now, she just wanted to go home.</p> <p>She held up her cell phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to go call them,&#x201d; she said, wincing as the guy in the Stetson on the stage unleashed a feedback shriek while trying to tune his guitar.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not really halfway,&#x201d; Sophie said, cocking her hip and folding her hands under her breasts so that they surfaced in the V of her summer dress. Right on cue, half a dozen pairs of beer-glazed eyes swung in her direction.</p> <p>Natalie rubbed a tired hand over her face. She&#x2019;d taken her longest shower in over a year before coming out tonight, combed and given a curl to her hair, which was still new-road black even if she hadn&#x2019;t had it cut in months, applied actual perfume for the first time since forever. And still, she smelled like Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p> <p>&#x201c;Excuse you?&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Forty-three. Isn&#x2019;t really halfway to eighty-seven.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a convenient stop on the road to Moronville.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Spoken like you&#x2019;ve been there,&#x201d; Sophie said. She&#x2019;d loosened her arms, let her breasts dip just far enough back into the V to draw at least a few of those beer-glazed gazes upward, and now she was having fun locking eyes with them. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not all their fault, after all. They&#x2019;re not the ones went and got themselves knocked up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because they&#x2019;re&#x2026;&#x201d; Natalie started, caught the eyes of one bespectacled, boots-sporting pretend-cowboy who&#x2019;d gone straight past Sophie to her, and felt herself blush. Did she really look decent in this dress anymore? Twenty-four years old and she already felt like a mom who&#x2019;d donned a cheerleader costume in the hopes of feeling sexy again. Except Sophie&#x2019;d been the cheerleader. And Johnson &amp; Johnson wasn&#x2019;t sexy, no matter what dress it was wearing. Only the mom part was right.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to check on our children,&#x201d; Natalie said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Watch this.&#x201d; Sophie pulled her arms in tight again, grinning as the poor bankers&#x2019; chins dipped. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s like playing beach ball with seals.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Two beach balls,&#x201d; Natalie muttered, and Sophie laughed.</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s my Nat.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; Natalie said, and moved off toward the hallway by the restrooms to get some relative quiet.</p> <p>When she came back ten minutes later, Sophie was sitting at a table near the stage with three guys in loosened ties, her unknotted blond hair spilling artfully over her one shoulder. In front of her sat three separate umbrella drinks, each a different shade of Day-Glo.</p> <p>&#x201c;Saved one for you,&#x201d; Sophie chirped.</p> <p>Natalie stared down at her oldest friend, flushed and smiling and still nowhere near pre-pregnancy weight and not caring. Then she stared at the drinks, then at the guys Sophie had collected. One of them bald, another black. Clean, pleasant faces, well shaven or meticulously unshaven. On the right, farthest from Sophie, sat the spectacle guy who&#x2019;d eyed her before. He was eying her still, shyly. He&#x2019;d pushed back far enough from the table that Natalie could just see the Kenneth Cole messenger bag leaning against his right boot. In spite of herself, and her now-perpetual exhaustion, and her own mother&#x2019;s voice still echoing in her ears&#x2014;Your babies are fine, Nat, God&#x2019;s sakes. Have a hard one on me&#x2014;she felt herself nod.</p> <p>&#x201c;Saved one,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What if I want two?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s my Nat,&#x201d; Sophie said, slapping the table while the black guy blinked and the bald guy trembled and spectacle banker&#x2019;s eyes went just a bit wider.</p> <p>The musician onstage was strictly Advanced Karaoke, perfect for a training-wheel New South bar like the Back Way Out, but he had some taste, at least. &#x201c;A Thousand Miles from Nowhere,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sally Sue Brown.&#x201d; Spectacle guy, once he got up the nerve to sprinkle in some conversation with the shy glances, turned out to be enough of a Baltimore Orioles fan to have recognized Merv Rettenmund at a truck stop once, which Natalie figured qualified him, at the very least, to hear her Dave McNally hiccough story a little later in the evening. After some dancing. If he could dance. She had her fingers curled around a tallboy, her head cocked just enough so she could hear Sophie&#x2019;s laughter over the music and spectacle guy&#x2019;s increasingly animated, friendly chatter, and had finally remembered what it was&#x2014;besides the boys, the beautiful, pitiful, sweating, shining boys&#x2014;that she really had almost loved about all this when the lights went out.</p> <p>They went all at once, as if there&#x2019;d been a power outage or someone had flipped a switch. As it turned out, that&#x2019;s what had happened, because of course the Back Way Out had no dimmers, no spotlight, wasn&#x2019;t set up for anything other than the game almost anyone who ever walked through its doors imagined they were playing. One row of track lights&#x2014;the wrong one, too far back near the bar&#x2014;blinked on, then off again. Then the row over the stage, right above their table, and Natalie squinted.</p> <p>&#x201c;Holy shit,&#x201d; she murmured. Spectacle guy hadn&#x2019;t even turned around, wasn&#x2019;t curious, was too hell-bent on getting to her. Which of course doomed him, as far as Natalie was concerned. Then she stopped thinking about him entirely.</p> <p>&#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; said Sophie, one hand grasping the black guy&#x2019;s forearm. &#x201c;You see that? That guy just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; boomed a gravelly woman&#x2019;s voice from the back. &#x201c;We hope you appreciate the gravity of your good fortune.&#x201d;</p> <p>The new figure onstage really seemed simply to have appeared, a junkie-thin scarecrow all in black, complete with button-up work shirt, unlaced, half-collapsed hiking boots that looked more like potatoes than shoes, and a completely incongruous sombrero that mashed his dark hair down around his face. His narrow nose tilted to the right, and his fingers seemed to tremble slightly as he sketched a wave at the drinkers of the Back Way Out and then slid his hands deep into his pant pockets. Natalie took all of that in but soon found herself staring at his mouth, which looked too rounded, the lips forming a near-perfect circle.</p> <p>&#x201c;He looks like a blow-up doll,&#x201d; Sophie whispered in her ear, hitting a simile exactly right, for once. Then she added, &#x201c;With a leak,&#x201d; and Natalie wanted to hug her, and also to cry, but she didn&#x2019;t know why.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know who that is, right?&#x201d; She watched the guitarist shift, straighten his Stetson, and go still, apparently awaiting some communication from his new companion.</p> <p>&#x201c;I know you do,&#x201d; said Sophie.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the Whistler. It has to be.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No shit.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the Whistler?&#x201d; said spectacle guy, and Sophie stuck her index finger to his lips and shook her head.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dude,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>What had Natalie expected them to play? Some George Jones wallow, maybe. One of the Blue Yodels. Something that let the Whistler communicate just how lonesome-sorry he was, since that&#x2019;s what he was famous for among the truckers who came into the Waffle House where Natalie worked nights and the handful of music-nerd friends from her two years at UNCC who&#x2019;d spirited her off on weekend jaunts into western Georgia, down to Lake Charles, Louisiana, in search of the ghosts and echoes of what they called the real stuff. As if ghosts and echoes were the closest to real anyone could get anymore. Her friends, she realized, would have been at once electrified and horrified to discover the Whistler at the Back Way Out.</p> <p>The Whistler cleared his throat, shivered his bony shoulders. Natalie half-expected stalks of straw to poke out through his buttonholes. Then he muttered low to the guitarist, who swayed in place. Broke into a dazed smile, as if he couldn&#x2019;t believe his luck.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, y&#x2019;all,&#x201d; he said, and tuned his E string again, even though it was already in tune. &#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d get a chance to do this. With this man.&#x201d;</p> <p>And then he broke into &#x201c;Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache.&#x201d; Too slow, at first, which agitated Natalie even more than it should have, until the Whistler glanced, just once, at the guitarist. The tempo picked up. Then more. As though the guy were a gas pedal and the Whistler had floored him. The whole room began to clap and shudder. Even before the Whistler pulled those pursed lips just a little tighter, preparing, Natalie knew she was in trouble.</p> <p>&#x201c;Pretty sure who that guy&#x2019;ll be loving, anyway,&#x201d; Sophie half-sang along, elbowing Natalie under her rib cage as the guitar chugged and the melody hit full gallop.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah. Me, too,&#x201d; Natalie murmured back. Followed by, &#x201c;I mean, shut up.&#x201d;</p> <p>But the Whistler had spotted her, now. No. Had been looking at her from the second he&#x2019;d slipped from the shadows. Had never, for one moment, looked elsewhere. Even as he pulled in breath and held it, she saw the edges of his mouth stretch toward smiling.</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh-oh,&#x201d; she said, holding the table.</p> <p>The Whistler let loose.</p> <p>Later&#x2014;so much later, dawn a red rip in the skin of the dark and birds already stirring in the poplars of whatever-the-hell park they&#x2019;d parked Sophie&#x2019;s Kia beside&#x2014;Natalie awoke facedown in a spill of blood atop someone&#x2019;s bare stomach. Sophie&#x2019;s stomach, she realized, sat up too fast, and grabbed the back of the front passenger seat as the world tilted over and the half a beer she was almost sure was all she&#x2019;d drunk shot up her throat. Even before the world steadied, she cried out, touched her fingers to the dried redness streaked across Sophie&#x2019;s abdomen and trailing into her belly button and up under her bare breasts. She shook her friend hard and realized, just as Sophie blinked awake, that there were no wounds she could see. Which meant the blood was hers?</p> <p>She frantically checked her own skin but found nothing of note except that it was bare, too. The shreds of her dress she located around her waist.</p> <p>Sophie sat up, cringing against even the faint light just spreading along the horizon. She ran a hand over herself, shoulder to hip, noted the blood, looked at Natalie. To Natalie&#x2019;s astonishment, she smiled. Sleepily. &#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Jesus Christ, Sophie.&#x201d; Natalie pulled enough of her dress together to shrug it partially closed around her shoulders. &#x201c;Did we&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Pretty sure,&#x201d; Sophie murmured, not bothering to cover any part of herself except her eyes.</p> <p>&#x201c;Both of us? With him? With the Whistler? How the &#x2026; how did that happen?&#x201d;</p> <p>For a long moment, they just sat. The light and the birdsong needled at Natalie, too, and she winced and closed her eyes. &#x201c;Could we go home now? To our children?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;d you do to my dress?&#x201d; Sophie said, trying to find enough buttons to close herself.</p> <p>They got out of the car, settled into the front seats. Even with the motor running, Natalie still imagined she could hear birds, a shrill warble driving up her ear canals toward her brain. &#x201c;Was that me? Did we really do that? Why?&#x201d;</p> <p>The clock on Sophie&#x2019;s radio read 4:45, too early for even the early-bird rush hour, and they passed unaccompanied and unobserved down the empty, tree-lined streets of suburban Charlotte, past the rows-upon-rows of pines and poplars and perfectly mown lawns and subdivision signs. The Oaks. The Hill. Oak Tree Hill.</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t remember a goddamn thing,&#x201d; Natalie said. But that wasn&#x2019;t true. It was coming back. Bits and flashes. The Whistler at their table with his pursed mouth and his sombrero-mashed hair, smiling sadly down at his hands, which trembled on the table like a butterfly he&#x2019;d caught. That woman appearing behind him. Pearl-wearing, pinch-faced African-American woman, grandmotherly glasses, rumpled green skirt-suit, disapproving frown. The three of them&#x2014;Natalie, Sophie, the Whistler&#x2014;in the car, in this car, much later. Sophie&#x2019;s soft lips against Natalie&#x2019;s own. Their hands up each other&#x2019;s dresses. The Whistler still there. Where?</p> <p>Natalie closed her eyes against the light and the woozy whirl of half memory. She put her hands to her ears, but that didn&#x2019;t help. When she opened her eyes, Sophie was squinting at her, holding up a shielding hand against the sliver of sun just peeking over the edge of the earth as they neared Honeycomb Corner, the trailer park where Natalie had grown up.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know,&#x201d; Sophie said quietly, steering with one hand, pulling her tangled hair straight with the other, &#x201c;I always kind of wanted to do that.&#x201d; She glanced toward Natalie. &#x201c;With you. Stop looking like that; why is that so shocking?&#x201d; Sophie looked away.</p> <p>Natalie blinked, winced, shook her head. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not &#x2026; it&#x2019;s just &#x2026; you did? I mean, you have?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kind of. Yeah. I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; She turned back to Natalie. And there was her smile. The ghost of it, fleeting and sad. &#x201c;I like you.&#x201d;</p> <p>She turned the Kia off Sardis into the dirt, and they jostled down the rutted track, between silent, rusting trailers hunched in their berths like pre-fab mausoleums. The curtains all drawn, doors shut, no one moving, nothing living. Even in the middle of the day&#x2014;let alone now&#x2014;with Skynyrd blasting out of the new hairy dirt-bike family&#x2019;s window and laundry drooping on dipping lines and people shouting at other people to shut up and kids smoking out by the perimeter fence or racing bikes up the dirt ruts and adults smoking everywhere, this place always reminded Natalie more of a cemetery than a neighborhood.</p> <p>Sophie parked in the shade of Natalie&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s double-wide. They sat together just a little longer, staring out the windshield, until Natalie said, &#x201c;Sophe? Are you sure &#x2026; I mean, what, exactly did we do?&#x201d;</p> <p>To Natalie, it sounded as though she were speaking through water. Sophie&#x2019;s movements seemed submerged, too, a slow sweep of her hand up her ruined dress, a long shrug. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Nat,&#x201d; she said, so softly. &#x201c;But it hurt.&#x201d;</p> <p>After that, Natalie stumbled inside and straight into her bed with that sound in her ears, blaring but from far, far away, like a tornado warning from another county.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2012, 2014 by Glen Hirshberg</p></p><h2>Nancy Drew #66</h2><p>If I'm in the game, I play to win.

Once heard, who can forget &#39;Henry King, Who chewed bits of String&#39; or the unfortunate lies of Matilda? The wicked humour ensures that they will remain favourites throughout the generations. This new edition has been carefully typeset to remain faithful to the original, and includes all of Basil Blackwood&#39;s brilliant black and white illustrations.</p><p>Hilaire Belloc was born in France and educated at Newman&#39;s Oratory School and at Balliol College, Oxford. From 1906 to 1910 he was Liberal MP for Salford and literary editor of the Morning Post. As well as writing books of verse and novels, he also wrote on religious, social and political topics.Adult/High School-Tales is written in the style of a picture book, with sprightly little rhymes that speak of the foibles of children and the horrible consequences thereof. First penned nearly a century ago, the sort of story that Belloc parodies continues to be written today and read to youngsters, but readers who are more sophisticated will better appreciate these tales of disproportionate punishment. Children are whimsically eaten by lions or consigned to life as a bootblack for their sins-or, by contrast, a boy who fires a loaded gun at his sister is reprimanded sternly. Gorey's artfully antiquated style exactly fits Belloc's writing and brings this edition to life-a single pen-and-ink line shows the sister's satisfaction at hearing her brother called to task. The previously unpublished illustrations meticulously convey texture, such as the clothing of the myriad physicians called in to help poor Henry King who swallowed string, and the expressions of the self-satisfied adults seem so earnestly and seriously drawn as to make the whole that much more humorous. The art is refined and genteel-never gory. Teenagers will enjoy this quick and cathartic read.<br><i>Paul Brink, Fairfax County Public Library System, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Down to the Bonny Glen (Martha Years)</h2><p><p>Martha is frustrated because Mum has said she's too old to be playing on the moors now, and she must have a governess.First there's Miss Norrie.

From award-winning journalist Max Wallace comes groundbreaking and astonishing revelations about the poisonous effect these two so-called American heroes had on Western democracy. In his wide ranging investigation, Wallace goes further than any other historian to expose how Ford and Lindbergh-acting in league with the Nazis-almost brought democratic Europe to the verge of extinction. <br><br>With unprecedented access to declassified FBI and military intelligence files, Wallace reveals how the close friendship and ideological bond between automotive pioneer Ford and aviator Lindbergh culminated in an abuse of power that helped strengthen Hitler's regime and undermined the Allied war effort. Wallace traces Henry Ford's ties to Nazi Germany back as far as the 1920s, presenting compelling evidence of a financial paper trail proving that Ford subsidized the rise to power of Adolph Hitler, who described Ford as "my inspiration." For the first time, the genesis of Ford's notorious Anti-Semitism is uncovered: <i>The American Axis</i> proves that Ford's private secretary and life-long confidante was a German spy, who channeled his employer's Jew-baiting crusades to further the cause of the Third Reich. <br><br>Lindbergh's own anti-Semitism and white-Supremacist views captured the attention of the Nazis, who soon manipulated him in their clandestine Fifth Column efforts. As the first unauthorized biographer to gain access to the Lindbergh archives, Wallace paints a substantially more chilling portrait of Lindbergh's pre-war activities than any previous historian and produces new evidence that the Nazis secretly plotted to install Lindbergh as the leader of the movement to keep America out of World War Two.<br><br>The most controversial corporate investigation since IBM and the Holocaust, the book reveals that the Ford Motor Company's military and political complicity in the Third Reich war effort was considerably stronger than the company has acknowledged and that a US Army post-war investigation concluded that the company had become "an arsenal of Nazism." Wallace disputes a recent internal investigation into the use of slave labor at Ford's German plant during World War II - which company officials claimed as a vindication of its wartime activities - and reveals that corporate President Edsel Ford was about to be indicted by the US government for "Trading With the Enemy" at the time of his 1943 death.<br><br><i>The American Axis</i> is not only a mesmerizing, cautionary tale, but a compelling historical expos�. <br></p><p>Max Wallace is a veteran investigative journalist and holocaust researcher.

In July, he announced to the <i>New York World</i> that "International financiers are behind all war ... they are what is called the international Jew: German Jews, French Jews, English Jews, American Jews ... the Jew is a threat."1From any other figure, the interview might have been dismissed as the ravings of a crackpot. But these words were uttered by the man who was arguably America's most respected and celebrated figure--a man whose achievements had already permanently altered the nation's economic and industrial landscape. This was the first signal that he was about to have a profound impact on America's social character as well.By 1919, Henry Ford had already secured his place as history's most important automobile pioneer. He had not invented the car or the assembly line, as many believed, but he had revolutionized both, radically changing the country's transportation habits with the introduction of the Model T--the nation's first affordable car. After proclaiming in 1908 that he would "build a motorcar for the great multitude," Ford had by 1913 turned out more than a quarter million units of the car Americans affectionately referred to as the "Tin Lizzie." According to economist Fred Thompson, Ford's car was the chief instrument of one of history's greatest changes in the lives of the common people. Farmers were no longer isolated on remotefarms. The horse disappeared so rapidly that the transfer of acreage from hay to other crops caused an agricultural revolution. The automobile became the main prop of the American economy.2 Within a short period, Henry Ford had joined the likes of Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Mellon as one of the country's industrial giants. Nonetheless, in 1913, five years after he first introduced the Model T, neither <i>Who's Who</i> nor the <i>New York Times</i> index contained a single reference to Ford or his company.3 His next innovation, however, was destined forever to put an end to this anonymity.At the beginning of 1914, the Ford Motor Company found itself in trouble. Two factors in particular were worrying the board of directors. Because of low wages and poor working conditions, it had become increasingly difficult to retain employees. Turnover approached 380 percent, and at one point it was necessary to hire nearly one thousand workers to keep one hundred on the payroll. More worrisome still was a campaign begun the year before by the nation's largest industrial union, the IWW, targeting Ford for unionization and encouraging the workers to stage a slowdown. Union pamphlets featuring such ditties as "The hours are long, the pay is small, so take your time and buck 'em all," had shareholders terrified for their profits.4Ford's assembly line had revolutionized production but it was also being blamed for the increasing dehumanization of workers.5 A letter to Ford from the wife of one of his assembly-line workers provides a touchingly humble indictment of the conditions in his factory at the time:My Dear Mr. Ford--Please pardon the means I am taking of asking you for humanity's sake to investigate and to pardon my seeming rudeness but Mr. Ford I am the wife of one of the final assemblers in your institution and neither one of us want to be agitators and thus do not want to say anything to make anyone else more aggrivated but Mr. Ford you do not know the conditions in your factory we are all sure or you would not allow it. Are you aware that a man cannot "buck nature" when he has to go to the toilet and yet he is not allowed to go at his work. He has to go before he gets there or after work. The chain system you have is a slave driver! My God! Mr. Ford. My husband has come home and thrown himself down and won't eat his supper--so done out. Can't it be remedied?6Her letter reflects nothing more than the norm in American industry at the beginning of the twentieth century. Workers were considered little betterthan beasts of burden; theirs was a grind of tedious and back-breaking labor from which any consideration for the employee's welfare was absent. The average worker toiled nine hours a day for a salary that barely approached subsistence levels. Profits were based on wages as low as a worker would take and pricing as high as the market would bear. Industrialists were regularly pilloried in the press as robber barons and caricatured in the nation's magazines as inhuman slave drivers. A decade earlier, President Teddy Roosevelt was cheered when he declared war on the industrial trusts he said were ruining the country.That was about to change. Whether motivated by a genuine concern for the welfare of his workers or a fear of unionization, Ford convened a meeting of his board of directors on Tuesday, January 5, 1914, to announce the revolutionary policy that would alter permanently the worker-employer relationship. Henceforth, he announced to the stunned silence of his colleagues, the minimum wage for Ford workers would be more than doubled from $2.34 a day to $5.00, and the working day would be cut from nine to eight hours.7 An elaborate system of profit-sharing would be introduced. "Our workers are not sharing in our good fortune," declared Ford. "There are thousands out there in the shop who are not living as they should."8 The effect was electrifying, signaling nothing less than a new era in American industry. The next morning, every newspaper in the land announced the new policy with blaring headlines. "It is the most generous stroke of policy between a captain of industry and worker that the country has ever seen," wrote the <i>Michigan Manufacturer and Financial Record.</i>9 According to the New York <i>Globe,</i> Ford's new wage scheme had "all the advantages and none of the disadvantages of socialism." Overnight, Ford was hailed as a national hero. One newspaper called him "the new Messiah." The only negative note was sounded by his fellow industrialists, who appeared to regard Ford as a traitor to his class, worried that their own workers would expect similar treatment. In an editorial, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>--voice of American Big Business--called the wage blatantly immoral, an "economic crime."10 Treating workers humanely would set a dangerous precedent that might threaten the entire capitalist system, the paper warned. To his detractors, Ford explained that the new policy was merely sound business practice, not a humanitarian gesture, and would result in increased productivity and higher profits.But grateful American workers saw humanity in it and sent thousands of letters and telegrams thanking him for his generosity. That week, police had to be summoned to quell a riot when more than 12,000 men lined up at the gates of the Ford plant in hope of a job.Newspaper reporters descended on the company's Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters to record the new hero's every utterance. Ford was gladto oblige them. His homilies on every conceivable topic blended folksy wisdom with a homespun philosophy on life. On ability: "Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're right!" On self-reliance: "Chop your own wood, and it will warm you twice." On altruism: "A business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business." And the quote for which he would be best remembered: "History is more or less bunk." According to one study, Ford's wage hike created more than two million lines of favorable advertising on the front pages of newspapers and thousands and thousands of editorial endorsements.11Ford reveled in his newfound celebrity status. A shameless self-promoter, he used the media to create an entirely new persona, portraying himself as a self-made millionaire who had begun life as the son of a poor farmer in rural Michigan and clawed his way out of poverty to learn a trade and build his first car. He told story after story of the tremendous hardship he had endured as a child. However, according to his sister Margaret, "there was no truth in them." His father was in fact a prosperous landowner who owned a farm along with a number of other enterprises.12 Moreover, Ford assiduously cultivated the myth that he was a mechanical genius, even though his cars were engineered and designed by others.13 Instead, he assembled some of the finest mechanics available and used their expertise to build his industry."I don't like to read books," he once said. "They muss up my mind." According to one reporter who interviewed him, "Outside of business, where he is a genius, his mind is that of a child."14 Testifying years later at a libel suit after the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> called him an "anarchist," Ford--who never even graduated high school--demonstrated the extent of his historical knowledge under questioning by the paper's lawyer. Asked whether he knew anything about the American Revolution, he responded, "I understand there was one in 1812." <i>Any other time?</i> "I don't know of any others." <i>What about the one in 1776?</i> "I didn't pay much attention to such things." <i>Did you ever hear of Benedict Arnold?</i> "I have heard the name." <i>Who was he?</i> "I have forgotten just who he is. He is a writer, I think."15Nothing, however, could diminish Ford's stature with the public or the press. Countless newspapers called on him to run for President. The letters of admiration poured in by the truckload. And as Ford predicted when he instituted the five-dollar day, his company enjoyed an immediate surge in production and skyrocketing profits, making him a billionaire and one of the world's richest men. His name became a verb (to "Fordize" meant to manufacture at a price so low that the common man can afford to buy it) and a noun ("Fordism" referred to mass production resulting in sustained economic growth).16 Perhaps the best illustration of his newfound status was a nationwide poll in which Ford ranked as the thirdgreatest man in history behind only Napoleon and Jesus Christ.17It is difficult, nearly a century later, to portray accurately the magnitude of Ford's fame and influence brought on by the five-dollar day. In his 1932 classic <i>Brave New World,</i> Aldous Huxley attempts to reflect the time in his youth when Ford seemed an omnipresent force. In the novel, set far in the future, Huxley creates a utopian society where universal happiness has been achieved and people are conditioned to love their work. The entire society reveres the "Apostle of Mass Production," Henry Ford, who is worshipped like a God.18 Time is measured from when Ford first introduced the assembly line. Thus, the story is set in 632 A.F. (After Ford). Adherents cross themselves in the sign of the "T."Small wonder, then, that when Ford first announced his philosophy toward the Jews to the <i>New York World</i> in 1919, it carried no inconsiderable impact. That same year, he quietly purchased a small weekly newspaper called the <i>Dearborn Independent</i>, opened an office in an engineering laboratory next to his tractor plant, and assembled a staff in preparation for a crusade that was about to leave a pronounced scar on the face of American society. For the first sixteen months of its operation, under the editorship of former <i>Detroit News</i> editor Edwin Pipp, the <i>Independent</i> was barely distinguishable from any other weekly newspaper. It supported Prohibition, prison reform and the Versailles Treaty, printed innocuous articles about local issues, and mentioned Jews not at all. But before long, Pipp later recalled, Ford began to bring up Jews "frequently, almost continuously," until his new obsession eventually found its way into the newspaper.19On May 22, 1920, under a banner that announced the <i>Independent</i> as "The Ford International Weekly," a huge bold headline fired the opening salvo: THE INTERNATIONAL JEW: THE WORLD'S PROBLEM. For the next ninety-one weeks, each edition of the <i>Dearborn Independent</i>--promising its readers to serve as the "Chronicler of the Neglected Truth"--added further embellishments to the picture of a Jewish conspiracy so vast and far-reaching that the tentacles of the Jews supposedly touched every facet of American life. "In America alone," announced the paper, "most of big business, the trusts and the banks, the natural resources and the chief agricultural products, especially tobacco, cotton and sugar, are in control of Jewish financiers and their agents. Jewish journalists are a large and powerful group here ... Jews are the largest and most numerous landlords ... They absolutely control the circulations of publications in this country."Pipp resigned in protest over the paper's new editorial direction and was replaced by former <i>Detroit News</i> reporter William J. Cameron, who would serve Ford well over the ensuing two decades.No American institution, according to the <i>Independent</i>, was immune from the grasp of Jewish control. "Whichever way you turn to trace theharmful streams of influence that flow through society, you come upon a group of Jews," it declared. "If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball, they have it in three words: too much Jew." Jazz music was "Jewish moron music." The Federal Reserve was designed by "Jew bankers" to put the nation's money under the control of a "Jewish cabal."Each week readers were treated to what Ford's paper called "a lesson" in the insidious tricks Jews used to control the country. These included "the gentle art of changing Jewish names" to disguise their ethnicity. Once disguised as Gentiles, the reasoning went, the Jews' goal was to eradicate Christian virtues.To Henry Ford, who had famously claimed history is "bunk," the <i>Independent</i> was the forum for a history tailored to his own worldview. He dispatched a team of detectives to dig up the evidence that Jews were behind all that was evil in the country. For example, the paper claimed, America was not discovered by Christopher Columbus but by a Jewish interpreter named Luis de Torres--for the purpose of finding and exploiting tobacco, a substance Ford linked to "degeneracy." Benedict Arnold was merely a Jewish pawn who betrayed his country at the behest of Jewish moneylenders. 20 The underlying theme of the series was clear. Jews were attempting to take control of the United States--not by force, but by stealth. In Ford's paranoid conception, the menace was ubiquitous. "If there is one quality that attracts Jews, it is power," the paper announced. "Wherever the seat of power may be, thither they swarm obsequiously."Anti-Semitism was not unknown to the United States before the <i>Independent</i> began its campaign. As early as 1862, one year before Ford was born, President Lincoln was forced to declare anti-Semitism inimical to U.S. government policy after General Ulysses S. Grant issued an order barring Jewish peddlers from selling merchandise to Union soldiers. Lincoln immediately countermanded the order, declaring, "To condemn a class (of people) is to condemn the good with the bad. I do not like to hear an entire class or nationality condemned on account of a few sinners."21 At the time, such incidents were rare. Yet, a wave of European immigration during the late nineteenth century had brought more than a million Jews to America, resulting in a marked increase in anti-Semitic sentiment, especially among the Protestant upper classes.22 Caricatures of Jews as crook-nosed moneylenders often ...</p><h2>Immoral Certainty</h2><p>Assistant District Attorney Butch Karp and his colleague, Marlene Ciampi, investigate the suspect in three savage murders and follow a trail of death and insanity from a posh day-care center to the Mafia to a monstrous killer.

On the high seas, in England and in France, on the sugar islands of the Caribbean, and on the battlefield of Yorktown, Cutler proves his mettle and wins the love?and allegiance to the infant republic?of a beautiful English aristocrat from the arms of Horatio Nelson himself. &#34;&#34;A Matter of Honor&#34;&#34; is deeply researched and eloquently told.

The maritime action follows the adventures of Richard Cutler, a young rebel who signs on as a midshipman aboard the <i>Ranger</i>, a sloop-of-war of the fledgling Continental navy captained by John Paul Jones. Cutler's motives are independence for his country and revenge for his older brother, Will, who was seized from a merchantman and flogged to death by the Royal Navy. Serving alongside Jones on the <i>Ranger</i> and later the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i>, Cutler fights in dramatic sea battles and meets many of the key characters in the Revolution, including Ben Franklin, the Marquis de Lafayette and John Adams. He also shares his romantic interest in British beauty Katherine Hardcastle with a young British naval officer, but his capture off the British coast could mean he misses out on the war and the woman. Drawing on five years of historical research and a lifetime of sailing, Hammond vividly recreates an early chapter in American history. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bringing Jordan back wasn't easy because he had gone insane, murdered his fellow Green Lanterns, become all-powerful villain Parallax, and finally been transformed into the latest embodiment of godlike vengeance spirit the Spectre.

In 1910 he decided to search for the diaries of the ill-fated Mylius-Erichsen expedition, which had set out to prove that Robert Peary&#x2019;s outline of the East Greenland coast was a myth, erroneous and presumably self-serving. Iver Iversen was a mechanic who joined Mikkelsen in Iceland when the expedition&#x2019;s boat needed repair. Several months later, Mikkelsen and Iversen embarked on a journey during which they would suffer virtually every travail in the Arctic repertoire: implacable cold, scurvy, starvation, frostbite, snow blindness, plunges into icy seawater, Sisyphean sledging conditions, Vitamin A poisoning, debilitated dogs, apocalyptic storms, gaping crevasses, and assorted mortifications of the flesh. Mikkelsen&#x2019;s diary was eaten by a bear. Three years of this, coupled with seemingly no hope of rescue, would drive most crazy, yet the two retained both their sanity and their humor.

It tells the story of Victor Frankenstein, who plunders graveyards to create a new being from the bodies of the dead - but whose botched creature causes nothing but murder and destruction. Written after a nightmare when its author was only eighteen, <i>Frankenstein</i> gave birth to the modern science fiction novel.</p><p>The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p></p><p>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is one of the masterpieces of nineteenth-century Gothicism. While stay-ing in the Swiss Alps in 1816 with her lover Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, and others, Mary, then eighteen, began to concoct the story of Dr. Victor Frankenstein and the monster he brings to life by electricity. Written in a time of great personal tragedy, it is a subversive and morbid story warning against the dehumanization of art and the corrupting influence of science. Packed with allusions and literary references, it is also one of the best thrillers ever written. Frankenstein; Or, the Modern Prometheus was an instant bestseller on publication in 1818. The prototype of the science fiction novel, it has spawned countless imitations and adaptations but retains its original power.<br>This Modern Library edition includes a new Introduction by Wendy Steiner, the chair of the English department at the University of Pennsylvania and author of The Scandal of Pleasure. <br>Mary Shelley was born Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in 1797 in London. She eloped to France with Shelley, whom she married in 1816. After Frankenstein, she wrote several novels, including Valperga and Falkner, and edited editions of the poetry of Shelley, who had died in 1822. Mary Shelley died in London in 1851.Contains an 8-page plate section with long-unavailable pictures and drawings relating to Mary Shelley and Frankstein. Thoroughly edited and extensively annotated.

Although experts are beginning to understand the potential dangers of these substances, there are still more than 80,000 synthetic compounds that have not been sufficiently tested to interpret their effects on human health. Yale University&nbsp;professor John Wargo has spent much of his career researching the impact of chemical exposures on women and children. In this book, he explains the origins of society&#x2019;s profound misunderstanding of everyday chemical hazards and offers a practical path toward developing greater &#x201c;green intelligence.&#x201d;</p><p>Despite the rising trend in environmental awareness, information about synthetic substances is often unavailable, distorted, kept secret, or presented in a way that prevents citizens from acting to reduce threats to their health and the environment. By examining the histories of five hazardous technologies and practices, Wargo finds remarkable patterns in the delayed discovery of dangers and explains the governments&#x2019; failures to manage them effectively. Sobering yet eminently readable, Wargo&#x2019;s book ultimately offers a clear vision for a safer future through prevention, transparency, and awareness.</p></p><p><b>John Wargo</b> is professor of environmental policy, risk analysis, and political science at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies and the Department of Political Science at Yale University.

K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy explore why, despite unbounded opportunities for innovation, companies still can't satisfy customers and sustain profitable growth. The explanation for this apparent paradox lies in recognizing the structural changes brought about by the convergence of industries and technologies; ubiquitous connectivity and globalization; and, as a consequence, the evolving role of the consumer from passive recipient to active co-creator of value. Managers need a new framework for value creation. Increasingly, individual customers interact with a network of firms and consumer communities to co-create value. No longer can firms autonomously create value. Neither is value embedded in products and services per se. Products are but an artifact around which compelling individual experiences are created. As a result, the focus of innovation will shift from products and services to experience environments that individuals can interact with to co-construct their own experiences. These personalized co-creation experiences are the source of unique value for consumers and companies alike.<br><br>In this emerging opportunity space, companies must build new strategic capital&#x2014;a new theory on how to compete. This book presents a detailed view of the new functional, organizational, infrastructure, and governance capabilities that will be required for competing on experiences and co-creating unique value.<br></p><p><b>C. K. Prahalad</b> is the Harvey C. Fruehauf Professor of Business Administration at the University of Michigan Business School and co-author of the landmark best seller, <i>Competing for the Future</i>. His research, for over twenty years, has consistently focused on "next" practices. <b>Venkat Ramaswamy</b> is the Michael R. and Mary Kay Hallman Fellow of Electronic Business and Professor of Marketing at the University of Michigan Business School. His research focuses on new frontiers in co-creating value.According to this turgid volume of business metaphysics, dwindling profit margins caused by intensified competition, a glut of commodity production and knowledgeable, web-empowered consumers will usher in "a new industrial system" characterized by "co-creating value through personalized experiences unique to the individual consumer." Under the new regime, headstrong consumers will "seek to exercise their influence in every part of the business system," and companies will accommodate them by, for example, allowing them to design their own individualized cosmetics and houseboats (an innovation whose benefits include "emotional bonding with... the company" and "a greater degree of self-esteem"). Rather than simply selling their products and services, companies will design "experience environments" that comfort the consumer in any contingency, such as General Motors' On-Star satellite communications system, which can summon help after an accident, open the car doors if the driver is locked out and direct motorists to the nearest Italian restaurant. Beneath the avant-garde terminology, the book mostly boils down to a medley of strategies to make business more consumer-friendly, like flexible pricing schemes, electronic gadgets that are easy to use instead of baffling, options and add-ons, meticulous market research and lavish customer service and support. But business professors Ramaswamy and Prahalad, coauthor of Competing for the Future, inflate this rather familiar "customer-is-king" approach to a level of abstraction and mystification-the health-care industry, for instance, is actually "a complex, evolving wellness space"-that is needlessly opaque and portentous. Managers who thought their job was to make or do something that people might want to buy will be scratching their heads over this book. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He lives in Orange Beach, Alabama, with his wife Polly and their two sons.Bestselling inspirational writer and speaker Andrews (<i>The Traveler's Gift</i>) again blends fiction, allegory and inspiration and seasons it with a dash of autobiography. The result is a readable little tale of a mysterious old man named Jones&#x2014;just Jones, no mister&#x2014;who shows up in the lives of people in crisis. Jones brings the gift of perspective&#x2014;he notices alternative ways to think about things. Some of what he says is common sense: yes, sir works better than I guess. Some of what he says counters received wisdom: do sweat the small stuff, because little things can make a big difference as surely as brushstrokes make up a masterpiece. The narrator Andy is personable and appealing, and Jones is mysterious and brusque enough not to be a cloying Pollyanna. The title is awkward and not everyone likes motivational books, but many readers do. Andrews brings a track record, wordsmith skills and, best of all, an imagination. <i>(Apr. 28)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Men's fashion in Europe's fin de siecle climate, and the impact of ready-made garments are discussed in Part Two (1850-1914). Part Three (1914-1940) introduces the aesthetic of the sweater and the variations on the suit and vest as part of the post-World War I moral liberation and economic euphoria, and traces changes all the way through to the New Deal and the new American elegance. The post-World War II fashion revolution is described in Part Four (1940-1990) from zoot suits, spurred by the black American jazz scene, to London's Mod fashion of the 60s, Pierre Cardin and the new French style, the emergence of Italian chic, and the hippie and punk styles of the 70s. The book is completed by a perceptive discussion of contemporary designers such as Jean-Paul Gaultier, Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren, Comme des Garcons, and Yohji Yamamoto. <br><br>Farid Chenoune's lively and accessible text is filled with amusing anecdotes about male dress and grooming. He vividly places style transformations in the context of contemporary fashion criticism, history, social etiquette, manufacturing and marketing revolutions, and highlights public and private responses to fashion trends.

If we were to stop for a moment to consider where all of these foods have come from and how they have arrived on the shelves in conveniently packaged forms, then the connection between the food we eat and the way we live our lives would become apparent. Delve a little deeper still and what begins to emerge is the history of the interaction between people and their food, which shows how close these connections have always been and gives us an indication of the influence food has had on the nature of society.</p> <p>The Stuff of Life<br> Food plays a central role in our lives: it is a necessity for all of us, a pleasure for many and an obsession for a few. It can bring us together and on occasion drive us apart, but there can be no getting away from the simple fact that we have to eat to live. The way in which people have provided for themselves through time and across cultures may be very different, but nevertheless the essential nature of sustenance remains much the same. From our hunting and gathering ancestors to the industrial agriculture and food manufacturing processes of today, food has been a common factor throughout our existence and wherever we live in the world.</p> <p>To begin at the beginning, this survey of the role of food in history starts with the foods of early hunters and gatherers before moving on to look at the adoption of agriculture and those foodstuffs eaten by the first farmers. From there we move on to the rise of cities and civilizations, while also taking in food cultures from around the world, and then carry on into the medieval period. Food provided the impetus for the Age of Exploration, when the Portuguese and Spanish began to open up trade routes around the world and were then joined by the Dutch and British. It would lead to the development of commercial networks and global financial systems as well as establishing the European empires which would come to dominate world history. European colonization of the New World would have a devastating impact on the indigenous cultures of the region and the foods they relied on, while, in the twentieth century, it would be behind the rise of America to global pre-eminence. In this way, we arrive at the industrial and postindustrial world of today, with its convenience foods and the brand names we find on those supermarket shelves.</p> <p>The Course of History<br> Some foods have had an enormous impact on history, such as bread or the potato, while the influence of others has been rather more subtle. Anzac biscuits, for instance, continue to connect the people of Australia and New Zealand with the experiences of their soldiers in the First World War and, in South Korea, kimchi bridges the gap between the traditional and modern in a rapidly changing society. A few drinks have also been included which, strictly speaking, might be stretching the definition of food a little, but, at the same time, the histories of some foods and drinks are so intertwined that it can become difficult to discuss one without the other. To give just one example, the connections between the trade networks supplying tea and sugar to Europe which developed during the eighteenth century mean that it would be difficult to grasp one without understanding the other. It is also true to say that the enormous impact tea has had on history, however it is classified, makes it impossible to ignore in a book such as this one.</p> <p>The book is arranged by date to bring a little order to what might otherwise tend toward chaos, but this is only a rough guide and, as some of the discussions span thousands of years, it is probably best to take the chronology with a pinch of salt. But what we can say with confidence is that food has not only sustained us throughout our history, it has also played a crucial role in the way we live our lives, as it will no doubt continue to do in the future. If it is true to say that we are what we eat, then the examples described here show us that it is equally the case that what we eat makes us who we are.</p></p><h2>Mountain Men</h2><p>To know how the West was really won, start with the exploits of these unsung buckskin heroes. <br></p><p>To know how the West was really won, start with the exploits of these unsung mountain men who, like the legendary Jeremiah Johnson, were real buckskin survivalists.

His story begins at the end of the world: Dallas, New Year's Eve 1999, when he gathers with the congregation of his grandfather's black evangelical church to see which of them will be carried off. His beautiful, fragile mother disappears frequently and mysteriously; for a brief idyll, he and his sister live like Boxcar Children on her disability checks. When Casey--following in the footsteps of his father, a gridiron legend who literally broke his back for the team--is recruited to play football at Yale, he enters a world he's never dreamed of, the anteroom to secret societies and success on Wall Street, in Washington, and beyond. But even as he attains the inner sanctums of power, Casey sees how the world crushes those who live at its margins. He sees how the elite perpetuate the salvation stories that keep others from rising. And he sees, most painfully, how his own ascension is part of the scheme. <br><br><i>There Will Be No Miracles Here</i> has the arc of a classic rags-to-riches tale, but it stands the American Dream narrative on its head. If to live as we are is destroying us, it asks, what would it mean to truly live? Intense, incantatory, shot through with sly humor and quiet fury,<i> There Will Be No Miracles Here</i> inspires us to question--even shatter--and reimagine our most cherished myths.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of October 2018:</strong> Casey Gerald begins and ends his passionate, voicey memoir by describing a photograph of his family taken in the early 1990s, when he was just a little boy.

Soon they will be destroyed. They will destroy each other. They will destroy themselves.&#x201d; That prophetic voice, learned, perhaps, in the evangelical church Gerald&#x2019;s grandfather founded, gives <em>There Will Be No Miracles Here</em> drama and gravity that is surprising given Gerald&#x2019;s youth, but well-suited to his bust-to-boom-and-back-again story of growing up poor, gifted, and gay. </p> Gerald left behind his troubled family in Dallas and headed east to play football for Yale, intern at Lehman Brothers, and then study for an MBA at Harvard. A grand career in politics beckoned, but Gerald&#x2019;s soul, nurtured by the language of literature (from the Bible to <em>The Boxcar Children</em> to <em>The Invisible Man</em>), proved too big for such worldly goals, and he returned to Texas to find himself. <em>There Will Be No Miracles Here</em> isn&#x2019;t one of those memoirs politicians write before announcing an electoral run&#x2014;it is something more complicated and nuanced: a depiction of the causes and costs of &#x201c;upward&#x201d; mobility.

This book traces their history and fluctuating fortunes, and plots their place in the future. The author travelled widely to research the book and pictures of the last pure-bred animal of some breeds, such as the Garfagnina, the Fribourgeois and the Norfolk Horn, are included. Breeds such as the White Park cattle, which probably were sacrificed by the Druids, the Soay sheep, from the St Kilda Islands beyond the Outer Hebrides, the Texas Longhorn, and the Caspian horse, are an integral part of our history and heritage. Their survival is a matter of priority, and this book dicusses a policy to secure their qualities for succeeding generations.</p><p></p><h2>Breaking and Entering: Landing Your First Job in Film Production</h2><p>An A to Z introduction for anyone who wants to get their feet wet in film production.</p><p>April Fitzsimmons' Breaking &amp; Entering: Land Your First Job in Film Productionis a useful, informative and practical career guide to breaking into film or television production and having a good time along the way.

Schwartz</b> was a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta and the president of Creative Educational Services, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in leadership development.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Believe You Can Succeed and You Will</b> </p><p> Success means many wonderful, positive things. Success means personal prosperity: a fine home, vacations, travel, new things, financial security, giving your children maximum advantages. Success means winning admiration, leadership, being looked up to by people in your business and social life. Success means freedom: freedom from worries, fears, frustrations, and failure. Success means self-respect, continually finding more real happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for those who depend on you. </p><p> Success means winning. </p><p> Success -- achievement -- is the goal of life! </p><p> Every human being wants success. Everybody wants the best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys crawling, living in mediocrity. No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go that way. </p><p> Some of the most practical success-building wisdom is found in that Biblical quotation stating that faith can move mountains. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can move a mountain and you can. Not many people believe that they can move mountains. So, as a result, not many people do. </p><p> On some occasion you've probably heard someone say something like, "It's nonsense to think you can make a mountain move away just by saying 'Mountain, move away.' It's simply impossible." </p><p> People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can't <i>wish</i> away a mountain. You can't <i>wish</i> yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into a five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can't wish yourself into a position of leadership. </p><p> But you <i>can</i> move a mountain with belief. You <i>can</i> win success by believing you can succeed. </p><p> There is nothing magical nor mystical about the power of belief. </p><p> Belief works this way. Belief, the "I'm-positive-I-can" attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the <i>how</i>-to-do-it develops. </p><p> Every day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs. Each of them "wishes" that someday he could enjoy the success that goes with reaching the top. But the majority of these young people simply don't have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don't reach the top. Believing it's impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps that lead to great heights. Their behavior remains that of the "average" person. </p><p> But a small number of these young people really believe they will succeed. They approach their work with the "I'm-going-to-the-top" attitude. And with substantial belief they reach the top. Believing they will succeed -- and that it's not impossible -- these folks study and observe the behavior of senior executives. They learn how successful people approach problems and make decisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people. </p><p> The how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it. </p><p> A young woman I'm acquainted with decided two years ago that she was going to establish a sales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by many that she shouldn't -- and couldn't do it. </p><p> She had less than $3,000 in savings, and was advised the minimum capital investment required was many times that. </p><p> "Look how competitive it is," she was advised. "And besides, what practical experience have you had in selling mobile homes, let alone managing a business?" her advisors asked. </p><p> But this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She quickly admitted she lacked capital, that the business was very competitive, and that she lacked experience. </p><p> "But," she said, "all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile home industry is going to expand. On top of that, I've studied my competition. I know I can do a better job of merchandising trailers than anybody else in this town. I expect to make some mistakes, but I'm going to be on top in a hurry." </p><p> And she was. She had little trouble getting capital. Her absolutely unquestioned belief that she could succeed with this business won her the confidence of two investors. And armed with complete belief, she did the "impossible" -- she got a trailer manufacturer to advance her a limited inventory with no money down. </p><p> Last year she sold over $1,000,000 worth of trailers. </p><p> "Next year," she says, "I expect to gross over $2,000,000." </p><p> Belief, <i>strong belief,</i> triggers the mind to figuring ways and means and how-to. And believing you can succeed makes others place confidence in you. </p><p> Most people do not put much stock in belief. But some, the residents of Successfulville, USA, do! Just a few weeks ago a friend who is an official with a state highway department in a Midwestern state related a "mountain-moving" experience to me. </p><p> "Last month," my friend began, "our department sent notices to a number of engineering companies that we were authorized to retain some firm to design eight bridges as part of our highway building program. The bridges were to be built at a cost of $5,000,000. The engineering firm selected would get a 4 per cent commission, or $200,000, for its design work. </p><p> "I talked with 21 engineering firms about this. The four largest decided right away to submit proposals. The other 17 companies were small, having only 3 to 7 engineers each. The size of the project scared off 16 of these 17. They went over the project, shook their heads, and said in effect, 'It's too big for us. I wish I thought we could handle it, but it's no use even trying.' </p><p> "But one of these small firms, a company with only three engineers, studied the plans and said, 'We can do it. We'll submit a proposal.' They did, and they got the job." </p><p> Those who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can't, cannot. Belief triggers the power to do. </p><p> Actually, in these modem times belief is doing much bigger things than moving mountains. The most essential element -- in fact, <i>the</i> essential element -- in our space explorations today is belief that space can be mastered. Without firm, unwavering belief that man <i>can</i> travel in space, our scientists would not have the courage, interest, and enthusiasm to proceed. Belief that cancer can be cured will ultimately produce cures for cancer. Currently; there is some talk of building a tunnel under the English Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on whether responsible people believe it can be built. </p><p> Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific discoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization. Belief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient in successful people. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can succeed and you will. </p><p> Over the years I've talked with many people who have failed in business ventures and in various careers. I've heard a lot of reasons and excuses for failure. Something especially significant unfolds as conversations with failures develop. In a casual sort of way the failure drops a remark like "To tell the truth, I didn't think it would work" or "I had my misgivings before I even started out" or "Actually, I wasn't too surprised that it didn't work out." </p><p> The "Okay-I'll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don't-think-it-will-work" attitude produces failures. </p><p> Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts "reasons" to support the disbelief. Doubt, disbelief, the <i>subconscious will to fail,</i> the <i>not really wanting</i> to succeed, is responsible for most failures. </p><p> Think doubt and fail. </p><p> Think victory and succeed. </p><p> A young fiction writer talked with me recently about her writing ambitions. The name of one of the top writers in her field came up. </p><p> "Oh," she said, "Mr. X is a wonderful writer, but of course, I can't be nearly as successful as he is." </p><p> Her attitude disappointed me very much because I know the writer mentioned. He is not super-intelligent nor super-perceptive, nor super-anything else except super-confident. He believes he is among the best and so he acts and performs the best. </p><p> It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers. </p><p> Look at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can't do big things, and he doesn't. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him. </p><p> Now look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much, and he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments -- and he does. Everything he does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say, "Here is a professional. He is an important person." </p><p> A person is a product of his own thoughts. Believe Big. Adjust your thermostat forward. Launch your success offensive with honest, sincere belief that you can succeed. Believe big and grow big. </p><p> Several years ago after addressing a group of business men in Detroit, I talked with one of the gentlemen who approached me, introduced himself, and said, "I really enjoyed your talk. Can you spare a few minutes? I'd like very much to discuss a personal experience with you." </p><p> In a few minutes we were comfortably seated in a coffee shop, waiting for some refreshments. </p><p> "I have a personal experience," he began, "that ties in perfectly with what you said this evening about making your mind work for you instead of letting it work against you. I've never explained to anyone how I lifted myself out of the world of mediocrity; but I'd like to tell you about it." </p><p> "And I'd like to hear it," I said. </p><p> "Well, just five years ago I was plodding along, just another guy working in the tool-and-die trade. I made a decent living by average standards. But it was far from ideal. Our home was much too small and there was no money for those many things we wanted. My wife, bless her, didn't complain much, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate than she was happy. Inside I grew more and more dissatisfied. When I let myself see how I was failing my good wife and two children, I really hurt inside. </p><p> "But today things are really different," my friend continued. "Today we have a beautiful new home on a two-acre lot and a year-round cabin a couple hundred miles north of here. There's no more worry about whether we can send the kids to a good college and my wife no longer has to feel guilty every time she spends money for some new clothes. Next summer the whole family is flying to Europe to spend a month's holiday. We're really living." </p><p> "How did this all happen?" I asked. </p><p> "It all happened," he continued, "when to use the phrase you used tonight, 'I harnessed the power of belief.' Five years ago I learned about a job with a tool-and-die company here in Detroit. We were living in Cleveland at the time. I decided to look into it, hoping I could make a little more money. I got here early on Sunday evening, but the interview was not until Monday. </p><p> "After dinner I sat down in my hotel room and for some reason, I got really disgusted with myself. 'Why,' I asked myself, 'am I just a middle class failure? Why am I trying to get a job that represents such a small step forward?' </p><p> "I don't know to this day what prompted me to do it, but I took a sheet of hotel stationery and wrote down the names of five people I've known well for several years who had far surpassed me in earning power and job responsibility. Two were former neighbors who had moved away to fine subdivisions. Two others were fellows I had worked for, and the third was a brother-in-law. </p><p> "Next -- again I don't know what made me do this -- I asked myself what do my five friends have that I don't have, besides better jobs. I compared myself with them on intelligence, but I honestly couldn't see that they excelled in the brains department. Nor could I truthfully say they had me beat on education, integrity; or personal habits. </p><p> "Finally I got down to another success quality one hears a lot about. Initiative. Here I hated to admit it, but I had to. On this point my record showed I was far below that of my successful friends. </p><p> "It was now about 3:00 A.M., but my mind was astonishingly clear. I was seeing my weak point for the first time. I discovered that I had held back. I had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself deeper and deeper and found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn't believe inside that I was worth very much. </p><p> "I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself had dominated me ever since I could remember, how I had used my mind to work against myself. I found I had been preaching to myself why I couldn't get ahead instead of why I could. I had been selling myself short. I found this streak of self-depreciation showed through in everything I did. Then it dawned on me that no one else was going to believe in me until I believed in myself. </p><p> "Right then I decided, 'I'm through feeling second-class. From here on in I'm not going to sell myself short.' </p><p> "Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my new found confidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I'd hoped I would have courage to ask for $750 or maybe even $1000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I <i>was</i> a valuable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-analysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more saleable. </p><p> "Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial amount of stock plus a lot more pay." </p><p> Believe in yourself and good things <i>do</i> start happening. </p><p> Your mind is a "thought factory." It's a busy factory; producing countless thoughts in one day. </p><p> Production in your thought factory is under the charge of two foremen, one of whom we will call Mr. Triumph and the other Mr. Defeat. Mr. Triumph is in charge of manufacturing positive thoughts. He specializes in producing reasons why you can, why you're qualified, why you will. </p><p> The other foreman, Mr. Defeat, produces negative, depreciating tho...</p></p><h2>The Freemasons: A History of the World&#39;s Most Powerful Secret Society</h2><p>A respected historian and author of Napoleon III and Eugenie provides an in-depth history of freemasonry, exploring the inner workings of the powerful secret society, refuting many of the myths about the order, and shedding new light on the contributions of the freemasons to world history. Reprint. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Many books about the Freemasons are hysterical polemics based on ludicrous conspiracy theories. British historian Jasper Ridley offers a welcome antidote to these half-witted tomes with <i>The Freemasons</i>, a sober-minded account of a secret society that has survived for centuries. Most important, Ridley provides the one thing missing from many discussions of the masons: facts. For instance, after noting the "well-established legend in the United States that the Freemasons made the American Revolution," Ridley shows that "of the 55 men who signed the Declaration of Independence, only nine were certainly masons." (Prominent members of the founding generation who were <i>not</i> masons include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton.) This shows that masons have played a meaningful role in history, though not the domineering one their critics have alleged. Even though Ridley (who is not a mason) defends the masons against the overblown charges made against them, he doesn't quite buy the explanation that "they are no different from a golf club. ...Members of golf clubs do not take oaths not to reveal the secrets of the club." For a level- headed account of how a medieval guild of stone masons developed over time into an offbeat social organization with a powerful membership, Ridley's book is tough to beat. <i>--John Miller</i>Jasper Ridley�s many works include Napoleon III and Eugenie, Garibaldi, and Mussolini.

A huge U.S. flotilla of 800 ships carrying 162,000 men was about to attempt to smash into the outer defenses of the Japanese Empire. Their target was the Marianas Island group, which included Saipan, home to an important Japanese base and a large population of Japanese civilians, and Guam, the first American territory captured in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. During the next eight weeks, tens of thousands of men, hundreds of airplanes, and dozens of major warships were locked in mortal combat. When it was over, 60,000 Japanese ground troops and most of the carrier air power of the Imperial Navy were annihilated; Japan&#39;s leader, Tojo, was thrown out of office in disgrace; and the newly captured enemy airfields were being transformed into launching bases for the B-29s that would carry the conventional and, later, atomic bombs to Japan, turning the land of the Rising Sun into a charred cinder. After the U.S. victory in the Marianas campaign, the road to Tokyo was clearly in sight.</p><p><b>Victor Brooks</b> teaches at Villanova University and is the author of several books (available from Da Capo), including <i>The Normandy Campaign</i> and <i>The Boston Campaign</i>. He lives in Pennsylvania.A year ago, our nation was awash in commemorations of the sixtieth anniversary of the Normandy landings. Ignored in those celebrations was another "D-Day," the initial amphibious assault on the Marianas Islands in the Pacific, which began just nine days after the Normandy landings. The conquest of the Marianas ensured American supremacy in the central Pacific, crippled Japanese air and naval power, and left the Japanese home islands vulnerable to devastating B-29 attacks. Brooks is a professor and the author of several works on military history. He has written a detailed but very readable chronicle of a campaign notable not only for the heroism of its participants on both sides but also for the raw savagery of battle in which atrocities were common. Brooks provides cogent explanations of the broad strategic objectives of both Japanese and American military planners. He also offers a compelling portrait of Admiral Ernest King, the chief of naval operations. This opinionated, profane, and confrontational sailor was a brilliant naval strategist who has rarely received the acclaim he deserves. This is an excellent account of a campaign that guaranteed final victory in the Pacific theater. <i>Jay Freeman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The vivid, hilarious illustrations rendered by Audrey and Don Wood together offer fans a new dimension to their previous collaborations.<br></p><p><strong>Audrey Wood</strong>&nbsp;is the author of many books for children, including the bestselling <em>The Napping House</em>,&nbsp;<em>Piggies</em>,&nbsp;Caldecott Honor Book <em>King Bidgood's in the Bathtub</em>, <em>Heckedy Peg</em>, and <em>Piggy Pie Po,</em> all of which were illustrated by her husband, Don Wood. The Woods divide their&nbsp;time between California and Hawaii.&nbsp;Grade 1-4 A bad word, spoken by a small boy at a fashionable garden party, creates havoc, and the child, Elbert, gets his mouth scrubbed out with soap. The bad word, in the shape of a long-tailed furry monster, will not go away until a wizard-gardener cooks up some really delicious, super-long words that everyone at the party applauds. This single-idea cautionary tale has lively, absurdist pictures of tiara-crowned, formally dressed adults recoiling in horror or cavorting with glee when Elbert, the only child at the party, speaks a word. The transformation of a word into a visible, furry creature, makes its point clearly, but the long words offered as replacement (MY STARS! . . .RATS AND BLUE BLAZES! . . .ZOUNDS AND GADZOOKS!) are as alien to a modern child as the adult garden party with its butler and titled guests. The book may offer a way for adults to tackle the thorny problem of bad language, but good-boy Elbert, with his bow tie and soaped mouth, is unlikely to be a child's favorite story character.

Described by her friend Dolly Bantry as &#x201c;the typical old maid of fiction,&#x201d; Miss Marple has lived almost her entire life in the sleepy hamlet of St. Mary Mead. Yet, by observing village life she has gained an unparalleled insight into human nature&#x2014;and used it to devastating effect. As her friend Sir Henry Clithering, the ex-Commissioner of Scotland Yard, has been heard to say: &#x201c;She&#x2019;s just the finest detective God ever made&#x201d;&#x2014;and many Agatha Christie fans would agree.</p>Agatha Christie was born in Torquay in 1890 and became the best-selling novelist in history. Her first novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, introduced us to Hercule Poirot, the most popular detective since Sherlock Holmes. She is known throughout the world as the Queen of Crime and her works have sold over two billion copies -- 80 crime books, 19 plays, and six novels under the name of Mary Westmacott.</p><h2>JOEL OSTEEN JOKES - 2 Book Combo: 2 Hilarious Collections of Joel Osteen Jokes</h2><p>Every week Pastor Joel Osteen likes to get started with something funny.

Anthony, a renowned fantasy writer, creator of the Xanth series, dedicates a chapter called "The Early Part of Dying" to his fans and their sometimes highly personal correspondence, sharing their "inner agonies" (often he spends two full days a week answering letters). Some controversial segments focusing on the intricacies of the publishing industry might be applauded if they weren't so terribly black-and-white. Seemingly defensive, Anthony accuses the review industry of housing unqualified, subjective reviewers: "In a general way, many reviewers have a bias against success, so they try to bring down the most successful fiction while promoting the least successful." Discussing his novelizations of movies (e.g., Total Recall), he opines, "Novelizations are sneered at by critics, but of course it seems that everything that's interesting is panned by critics." His vitriol isn't reserved for the publishing biz: he hates Dallas, for instance, because JFK was assassinated there; based on that long-ago event, he's decided that Dallas's entire police force is still incompetent. His thoughts on his craft, not his focus on sales figures, make for the most interesting passages. "A writer who waits for inspiration may wait forever" is far more illuminating than "Do you ever wonder why the latest Stephen King novel is in every store?... To [publishers], books are just a product, and King sells better than Brand X." (Sept.)Forecast: Anthony has a ready-made audience. With print advertising in sci-fi and fantasy publications, this will have no trouble reaching them.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>The creator of Xanth has many firmly held opinions. One is that all his other opinions are of some interest to readers in general, to students of modern fantasy and sf, and to those curious about the strange and sinister ways of the publishing industry. After briefly summarizing his earlier years (already covered in <i>Bio of an Ogre</i>, 1988) and his career through 1996, Anthony turns thematic. He covers sex (including the opposite one), fans and fan mail, collaborations great and small, his various causes (many of them worthy), and, as always, his conflicts with what sometimes seems half of creation. Some of those war stories are unfortunately too plausible; about others one would like to hear other opinions. One ends up suspecting that Anthony emerged from a troubled Quaker upbringing with a commitment to do good works and has done them well, even if often in bad temper. As ogres go, he is somewhat reminiscent of the protagonist of the movie <i>Shrek</i>: fearful to contemplate, less so when his deeds are measured. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>M. de Guyenne</p> <p>1</p> <p>The children had been sent to play in the herber with Kate Puncherdown. The damsel hired to serve the youngest of four nobly born imps was glad to escape from indoor tasks on a bright June day, but she thought it due to her dignity to tell Agnes Rokster that it did not lie within her duty to wait upon the Lord John. Agnes said: &#x2018;I am sure it is never my lording who makes unease in the nursery! You may take him to oblige me.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You may take him because you are bid!' said Johanna Waring.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, well, to oblige you, Agnes !' said Kate.</p> <p>Johanna resented this, and took an unthinking revenge. &#x2018;And if I were you,' she said disastrously, &#x2018;I would not let my lord Humfrey go a step without you hold his leading-strings, for he looks so baggingly, poor sweeting, that I dread to see him walk into a wall and break his sely nose!'</p> <p>This was importable provocation. My lord Humfrey had an irregularity in his left eye, but to say that he squinted was a piece of wicked despite. My lord Humfrey he was not two years old was a child of singular promise: intelligent, well-grown, and (Kate said significantly) so lusty that he had never caused his mother to feel an hour's anxiety.</p> <p>The rush of colour to Johanna's cheeks should have told Kate that it was needless for her to add: &#x2018;What a pity that my lord Harry should be so sickly, and he the eldest!'</p> <p>It was fortunate that the nursery-tower lay at some distance from the Countess of Derby's chamber, for the jangle of strife would not have pleased her. But the Lady Blanche's nurse, swaddling the infant in fresh bands; and Johanna Donnesmere, who had charge of my lord Thomas, listened to the quarrel with unshadowed enjoyment, for each knew herself to be unassailable. No one could find fault with the fair babe in Isobel Staines's lap; and no one could deny that of all the Lancaster brood my lord Thomas was the stoutest as he was the most well-visaged. From the day that he had come fighting into the world (so unlike the Lord Harry, who had had to be slapped before he would draw breath!) he had not suffered a day's illness. My lord Thomas's nurse had never been obliged to sit through a distressful night because a fond grandparent had stuffed her charge with marchpane. While my lord Harry retched and retched, my lord Thomas, more than a year his junior, slept soundly beside him, no more disturbed by a surfeit of doucets than by a tumble from his pony. The worst anyone could say of my lord Thomas was that his was not an influence for peace in the nurseries; and not the most jealous nurse could pretend that a hot temper and a determination to have his own way were characteristics to be regarded with anything but pride.</p> <p>When everything that could possibly be said in disparagement of one boy of seven and one infant who had just learnt to walk out of leading-strings had been uttered, the quarrel ended, and Kate took the children into the garden, carrying Humfrey down the newel-stair, and giving John her hand to hold.</p> <p>The inner court was flooded with sunshine, and seemed oven-hot after the cool of the castle. It was almost surrounded by buildings, so that there was not enough stir in the air even to ruffle Kate's coif. Most of these buildings were new, including those on the south side of the court, which housed the family. Indeed, neither the Chapel, situated towards the base-court to the east, nor the Great Hall, occupying most of the western side, were quite finished. Masons and dauberers were always at work; and the ninety-foot front of the Hall was still masked by a scaffolding. Behind this, the walls, like the rest of the castle, glowed pink in the sunlight. The old Hall had looked much like the Keep, which towered at the north-east angle of the court, and had been built hundreds of years before, when even kings' palaces were lit only by slit windows; but the new Hall was quite a different style of building, with an oriel, and four other windows with pointed arches and many lights. They were richly ornamented; and ever since the family had removed from Peterborough to Kenilworth the Countess's ladies had not ceased to complain that they could hear the &#x2018;chip-chip' of the masons' hammers even in their dreams. The nurses were not behindhand with their grutchings. It was predicted that while the Lady Blanche lost her sleep the lordings would break their necks, clambering over the scaffolding, and losing their footholds. But the Lady Blanche slept through the worst of the hammering; and although the lordings fulfilled the expectations of those who knew them best by swarming all over the scaffolding, and driving every honest craftsman out of his five wits by the pertinacity of their questions, not one of them had yet been picked up lifeless in the court.</p> <p>The lordings loved Kenilworth: loved it so much that throughout their lives it remained in their hearts a place of happiness, rosy-hued, and soaked in sunshine.</p> <p>2</p> <p>To reach the herber, which lay beyond the inner curtain wall, the little party had to pass the base of the Grand Staircase, which led up to the door into the Great Hall, traverse the kitchen courtyard, and go through a postern. It took time to accomplish the journey, since Kate allowed herself to be detained in the kitchen-court by a man-at-arms in the blue-and-white livery of the family; but the herber was reached at last, and my lord Humfrey set upon his feet. Too young to be interested in the disports of his brothers, he toddled off on some ploy of his own, and was soon happily engaged fast by the Swan Tower, a look-out built in the angle of the barbican. John paid no heed to his away-going, but squatted down with the toy he had found in the depths of a hutch in the nursery.</p> <p>It was a fascinating toy, originally one of a pair, given to Thomas by Cousin Richard, the King: two puppets, clad in armour, each holding in one hand a sword and in the other a buckler. The limbs were jointed, and there were strings attached to them, so that if you learned to manipulate them cunningly the puppets could be made to fight, like real knights. Only God and the devil knew what Cousin Richard had paid for them, had said Bel sire, their grandfather, when he saw them. Fool-largesse, he called the gift; but perhaps that was because it had been bestowed on Thomas, rather than on Harry, or on John, who was his namesake, and his favourite grandson. Only one of the mammets had survived Thomas's rough handling, and that one had long outworn its novelry, and had been tossed into the hutch, to lie forgotten there until John discovered it.</p> <p>It was hard for the fingers of a four-year-old to manipulate the mammet, but impatience was not one of John's failings. He set himself to master the toy; and Kate, seeing him thus absorbed, presently yielded to the becks of the man-at-arms, and left the curtilage. The children were quite safe: neither was old enough to climb the wall, and so tumble into the mere which lay at the foot of the castle mound; and if John took it into his head to explore the scaffolding round the Great Hall he would be obliged to pass through the kitchen-court on his way to it, and must so come under her eye again.</p> <p>No such ambition crossed John's mind; he was engrossed with the puppet, and would have continued to struggle with the wayward movements of its limbs had he not been interrupted. Thomas, released from his lessons, came bounding across the greensward, pulled up short beside his brother, stared for a moment, and then exclaimed: &#x2018;That's mine!'</p> <p>A mulish look came into John's face. He clutched the mammet to his chest, but said nothing.</p> <p>&#x2018;Give it to me!' ordered Thomas, stretching out his hand.</p> <p>&#x2018;No!' said John.</p> <p>This seemed to Thomas a monstrous thing. &#x2018;Why, you buzzard, you you hell-puck!' he cried, borrowing from the vocabulary of those worshipful craftsmen at work on the Great Hall. &#x2018;Give it to me at once!'</p> <p>Abusion left John unmoved; but as Thomas snatched at the manikin he quickly laid it down behind him on the grass. Unlike Thomas, who would have torn it asunder in the struggle to get possession of it, he was determined that it should not be broken in the inevitable fight. The next instant both the noble lordings were locked in what bore all the appearance of a death-grip. Thomas was a year older than John, but John was the more powerfully built, able to hold his own for several minutes. In the end, Thomas would overpower him, but he had once succeeded in tripping Thomas, and although he had been too much surprised to take advantage of this triumph he hoped one day to do it again, and to follow it up in a suitable fashion.</p> <p>Neither combatant was destined on this occasion to bring the other to the ground; they were wrenched suddenly apart, and found that their eldest brother, Harry, was between them. &#x2018;Fliting again!' said Harry, in mimicry of Johanna Waring. &#x2018;What's amiss?'</p> <p>Thomas, always jealous of Harry, said, &#x2018;Nothing to do with you!' and tried to close with John again.</p> <p>Harry held him off. He was a slim boy, but surprisingly strong. &#x2018;Stint!' he ordered. &#x2018;I said, what's amiss?'</p> <p>Thomas might resent Harry's assumption of authority, but he knew better than to provoke his anger. He said: &#x2018;He stole my mannikin!'</p> <p>Harry turned his eyes towards John. &#x2018;I did not!' John declared, going very red in the face at such a knavish accusation.</p> <p>&#x2018;What mannikin? Whose is it?' demanded Harry.</p> <p>&#x2018;Mine!' shouted Thomas.</p> <p>&#x2018;John?' said Harry, keeping his eyes on him.</p> <p>Harry had very bright eyes, the colour of hazel-nuts. When he was pleased they were as soft as a dove's, but when anything angered him their expression would suddenly change, and then they more nearly resembled the eyes of the lions painted on Bel sire's shield. The smallest feeling of guilt made it impossible to meet their challenge. John did not attempt the feat. He began to dig a hole in the greensward with the toe of one foot, and kept his gaze lowered. &#x2018;Well,' he said. &#x2018;Well...'</p> <p>He was almost felled to the ground by the buffet Harry dealt him. &#x2018;Give it to Thomas!' Harry commanded.</p> <p>He picked it up, and held it out rather blindly, since his eyes were watering. By the time he had blinked away this moisture Harry had gone, and Thomas, the mammet lying disregarded at his feet, was staring in astonishment towards the postern.</p> <p>John eyed him, but without much fear of reprisals. Thomas fell out of his rages as quickly as he fell into them, and never bore malice. He turned to look at John, exclaiming, &#x2018;He took my part!'</p> <p>John sniffed. &#x2018;You knew he would!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, I never thought it! Why did he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;He knew it was your mannikin,' said John, manfully owning the truth.</p> <p>&#x2018;But he likes you best!' said Thomas.</p> <p>This put all thought of the puppet out of John's head. There was no one whom John loved as he loved Harry, but it had not occurred to him that a brother removed from him by such a span of time as three years could prefer him to Thomas. He said: &#x2018;No, d-does he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No force! I was sure he would give the mammet to you!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No,' said John. &#x2018;It was yours.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if I liked anyone best I would take his part!' declared Thomas.</p> <p>&#x2018;Harry wouldn't.'</p> <p>&#x2018;He ought to!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not if it is wrong. Not Harry.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, wrong!' said Thomas. Tired of the discussion, he added: &#x2018;Here, you may have the mammet! I don't want it!'</p> <p>But when they looked for the mannikin it had vanished, because Humfrey, who had deserted his play to watch the fight between his brothers, had borne it off while they argued. By the time it occurred to them that he must have taken it, he had grown tired of a toy too intricate for him to manage, and had abandoned it in a bed of gillyflowers. When Thomas demanded to be shown where he had dropped it, his lip trembled, and he said piteously, &#x2018;Kate!' which was one of the few words he knew.</p> <p>&#x2018;I daresay he doesn't understand,' observed John.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, he does,' said Thomas, giving Humfrey a shake. &#x2018;Show me, Humfrey!'</p> <p>Whether or not Humfrey understood what it was that Thomas wanted, he perfectly understood that Thomas was displeased with him, and he broke into lamentation. His cries brought Kate Puncherdown to his rescue, her kirtle caught up in both hands, and her coif askew. She snatched him up, calling him her pig's eye, her cinnamon, her honey-hive, and scolding Thomas for having hurt him.</p> <p>&#x2018;What a little swineshead he is!' remarked Thomas. &#x2018;I didn't hurt him!'</p> <p>Kate wiped Humfrey's blubbered cheeks with the palm of her hand. He stopped crying, and suddenly chuckled. &#x2018;Thomas!' he uttered.</p> <p>Thomas knew that it was cunning, not fear, which had prompted Humfrey to set up a yell, but he was unresentful. No one could be angry with Humfrey for long. He said: &#x2018;Oh, well! Make him show where he put the mammet, Kate!'</p> <p>After some persuasion Humfrey pointed to the gillyflowers, but before his brothers had found the toy Kate said sharply: &#x2018;Listen!'</p> <p>They stood still, their heads jerked up.</p> <p>&#x2018;In the base-court! Someone has arrived!' said Kate.</p> <p>3</p> <p>When my lord Derby was from home his castles were so quiet that the visits of such everyday folk as a pardoner, selling indulgences; a chapman, with knacks to tempt the maids; or a wainsman, with a load of merchandise sent from London, were events of interest. The children made for the postern as fast as their legs would carry them. Thomas reached it first, and darted through it to the kitchen-court. Kate, hampered by Humfrey on her arm, brought up the rear. Her ears had not deceived her: someone had certainly arrived at Kenilworth, and someone of more importance than a chapman or a pardoner. The castle, which had before drowsed in the sunshine, now seemed to be alive with expectancy. Kate saw Thomas, and, shifting Humfrey to sit astride her hip, called out to him, &#x2018;Who is it, lording?'</p> <p>&#x2018;A herald!' shouted Thomas.</p> <p>&#x2018;Whose?' panted John.</p> <p>Thomas was not sure. It was an important part of any young bachelor's education to learn to recognise at a glance the shield, the colours, and the badges of a gentle family, but it was not an easily-mastered lesson, and he was not six years old, after all. He said: &#x2018;Well, I only saw him a hand-while. They have taken him in to Mother.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Perhaps he has brought a letter from my lord,' said Kate, in the voice of one resigned to disappointment.</p> <p>The lordings discarded this suggestion as unworthy. A herald would certainly be employed on such an errand, but it was more likely that this one had been sent to warn the Countess of the arrival of some distinguished visitor. A dizzy thought entered John's head, perhaps because Thomas's mannikin had brought Cousin Richard to his remembrance. &#x2018;Do you think it is the King?'</p> <p>Thomas stood spellbound for a moment. It was impossible that children of quick in-wit, living in a large household, should not have grasped from the clapping of servants that Cousin Richard was not universally held in high esteem, but in their eyes he was a magnificent personage, distributing largesse with a lavish hand, and indulging small cousins in a manner as gratifying to them as it was displeasant to their preceptors. He was said to hold exalted ideas of his state; but whenever the children had been in his company it had been with a conscience-stricken effort that they had remembered to say &#x2018;Sire,' and &#x2018;Pleaseth it your Majesty,' as they had been taught. Even Harry forgot the deference due to Cousin Richard when Cousin Richard called him his little nuthead, and played at kyle-pins with him, and pretended to hold him in awe, because (he said) he thought he must be the Henry of whom it was long ago prophesied that he would achieve such great...</p></p><h2>Of Fire and Night (The Saga of Seven Suns, 5)</h2><p><em>The Saga of Seven Suns is a galaxy-spanning SF epic, packed with politics, war, family intrigues and star-crossed lovers. <br><br></em>For years, the alien Klikiss robots have pretended to be humanity's friends, but their seeming "help" has allowed them to plant an insidious Trojan Horse throughout the Earth Defense Forces.

Earth defense forces gather up all the allies they can find, and the battles escalate. Much of the drama lies not in the action, but in the complex relationships among the characters. David Colacci's nuanced performance does justice to this complexity. Putting himself in the shoes of the characters, he captures their emotions and lets their personalities shine through with all their vulnerabilities and, in some cases, hidden strength.

Now, at a conference in Iceland, Artemis has gathered the fairies to present his latest idea to save the world from global warming.But Artemis is behaving strangely - he seems different. Something terrible has happened to him . . . Artemis Fowl has become nice.The fairies diagnose Atlantis Complex (that&#39;s obsessive compulsive disorder to you and I) - it seems dabbling in magic has damaged Artemis&#39; main weapon: his mind. Fairy ally Captain Holly Short doesn&#39;t know what to do. The subterranean volcanoes are under attack from vicious robots and Artemis cannot fight them. Can Holly get the real Artemis back ---before the robot probes destroy every human and life form?This eagerly-awaited adventure is now out in paberback with a fabulous new cover-look to celebrate ten years of Artemis action.</p><p>Eoin Colfer was born and raised in the south-east of Ireland. Artemis Fowl, his first book featuring the young anti-hero, was an immediate international bestseller and won several prestigious awards. It was followed by The Arctic Incident, The Eternity Code, The Opal Deception, The Lost Colony, The Time Paradox and now The Atlantis Complex. Artemis Fowl and The Atlantis Complex won the Independent Booksellers Award in the Children&#39;s Category, 2011.Artemis Fowl is at it again--or is he? In the seventh book of the series, Artemis seems to be a changed person. As he&#39;s pitching his latest scheme (yes, to save the world), trouble strikes. It is Artemis himself who is suffering from the Atlantis complex, a disease often attributed to guilt-ridden fairies. Nathaniel Parker skillfully voices the paranoia, obsession with numbers, and multiple personality disorder that is controlling Artemis. As the situation worsens and the LEP gang races to save the city of Atlantis, Parker perfectly orchestrates the timing and pace of the action-filled scenes--and should once more be praised for the consistency and range of his character voices.

A thousand years have passed since the world of Men and the world of the Folk collided in catastrophe. The wyr-powers of the Kyn and the other Folk have preserved their verdant homeland from the ravenous greed of Humanity since the Melding, but those powers are now under siege. As the hunger of Men turns once more to the Everland and its rich bounty, the leaders of the seven nations of the Folk gather in Sheynadwiin, the Kyn capital, to seek a way of surviving the growing storm.Born into a town dominated by the creeds of the accommodationist Shields, Tarsa&#39;deshae, a headstrong Kyn warrior, awakens to the long-suppressed wyr-ways after an act of courage goes horribly awry. Exiled from the only home she&#39;s ever known, and struggling to understand her new calling as a Wielder, Tarsa is swept into a dangerous world of political and spiritual intrigue, where the old ways of the Greenwalkers clash with those who would surrender to the new ways of Men. As the Everland faces the ever-encroaching threat of Humanity, the Redthorn warrior arrives at the Sevenfold Council in Sheynadwiin to help find a way to heal the ravages of her wounded world....</p><p>Daniel Heath Justice (Cherokee Nation) is Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Literature and Expressive Culture and Chair of the First Nations Studies Program at the University of British Columbia, unceded Musqueam territory.

Because spirituality involves more than simply prayer and piety, Madigan has selected women whose quests for intimacy with God also involves some visionary experience or social witness. Ranging from Perpetua in the third century to Mother Teresa and Edwina Gately in this century, her volume includes writings from both European women and, in the modern period, Asian, American, and African American women. Apart from redressing the heavy gender imbalance of most histories of Christianity, this volume also provides strong historical introductions to and bibliographies of the twenty-six women whose writings are generously excerpted. Women included in this volume are: Perpetua the Martyr Pelagia the Actress Brigit of Ireland Balthild the Queen of Neustria Dhuoda of Septimania Hildegard of Bingen Heloise Mechthild of Magdeburg Gertrude the Great Hadewijch Julian of Norwich Catherine of Siena Margery Kempe Teresa of Avila Jane Frances de Chantal Sojourner Truth Maria Stewart Gabrielle Bossis Dorothy Day Caryll Houselander Pauli Murray Laura Lopez Silvia Maribel Arriola Mother Teresa Cho Wha Soon Mercy Amba Oduyoye Edwina Gately</p><p>Shawn Madigan, C.S.J., is Professor of Theology and Christian Spirituality at the College of St. Catherine, St. Paul, Minnesota.From the Foreword: Dr. Madigan has brought together translations of spiritual writings from the church of the martyrs to twentieth-century Uganda. Her work has made further material available for growth into the 'art of arts and science of sciences,' namely, praying always. That the works are all by women or about women draws attention to the contribution women have always made to Christian spirituality. <p>From the Foreword: There are as many texts about the union of holy persons with God as there are texts about the ways in which human beings relate to each other. Among believers and unbelievers alike today, knowledge of oneself and others is a central preoccupation. For believers there is a point of enlightenment. Human relationships are seen to be contingent on ---and enlightened by-the mystery of personal relationship to God. The categories we use to order and divide human experience-for example, the gender categories of female and male-take on somewhat new and cohesive meanings in a spiritual realm that perceives all humans as feminine in their relationship to God. </p><p>In looking at spiritual writings by women, the intention is not to insist on a special "female spirituality" that somehow excludes men from knowing an intimate God. Rather, the writings of women in this collection are of interest for other reasons. First, they are not known by very many people, so their inclusion here makes them more broadly accessible. Second, the many-sided approach to prayer and communion with Jesus Christ these writings present is of great contemporary interest. </p><p>This is not to say that the writings of these women's male contemporaries are of less interest or importance. In a sense, women have more often been the enablers of written texts by men rather than the producers of texts. It is a matter of historical fact that the Roman women who asked Jerome to clarify his explanation of the Scriptures inspired him to do so. A group of Anglo-Saxon nuns found the words of the Canticle of Habakkuk obscure, even though they prayed it weekly in the office of Lauds. They asked Beke to analyze it for them so that they could pray it with understanding. Great women of the eleventh century asked Anselm of Canterbury to provide them with texts that would help them in their main work of prayer. </p><p>Such a combination of enabling and producing was not so much a statement about gender potential for union with God as it was about the availability of different kinds of learning. The human categories of male and female had little to do with the essence of communion with God. Bernard of Clairvaux wrote to Hildegard of Bingen, "you are said to be able to search the secrets of heaven and to discern by the light of the Holy Spirit things that are beyond human knowledge" (Letter 390 of Bernard of Clairvaux). Bernard is indicating here that women as well as and men have a potential receptivity to the mysteries of God. The recognition does not, however, imply a difference of function based on gender. </p><p>In the present work, Dr, Madigan has brought together translations of spiritual writings from the church of the martyrs to twentieth-century Uganda. In accomplishing this, she has greatly expanded the material that is available for growth into the "art of arts and sciences of sciences," namely, praying always. That the works are all by women or about women draws attention to the contribution women have made down through the centuries to Christian spirituality. Highlighting this role is especially timely in this age when women's involvement in other areas of life-social, legal, and economic-is increasingly stressed.</p></p><h2>Chevrolet Summers, Dairy Queen Nights: Of Cloudless and Carefree American Days</h2><p>A popular journalist presents a nostalgic tour of the quintessentially American way of life, from the heroics of a small-town policeman to the wisdom of Frank Sinatra on his last tour to Minnesota&#39;s grand, awful Mall of America. 25,000 first printing.

Visit Boom at his website: www.bigboombooks.com.<b>One</b> <i>Who Is Boom?</i> <b></b><p><b> I'm the Bodyguard for Women's<br> Hearts, Not a Sell-out. </b> </p><p> I call myself the Bodyguard for Women's Hearts because everything I am going to share with you I have learned from my years of experience running the streets. My marriage, my family, my struggles, what made me change my life, my lifestyle, the reason I made the change to live a happy and healthier life. I once heard a great saying: "You will no longer need my shoulder to cry on, but you can still use it to stand on to view your new world" after reading this book. </p><p> When guys look at me and say, "Man, you are nothing but a sellout," I agree with them to a certain degree. I usually say, "Hey, man, I appreciate that, because that is a confirmation. A confirmation of the promise God has made me. Yes, my man, you are right on point. He promised I would sell out of my books." So when they call me a "sellout," I certainly don't look at it in a negative way. </p><p> You won't know the magnitude of the changes I have made until you know something about the "Old Boom." The Old Boom was a boy who grew up with a womanizer as a father. When I was a small boy, he raised me to be like him, and I took on some of the same traits. That is why I was one of the best fools you would have ever met. I found out later in the game that my father learned these traits from his father. My bloodline had so much dirt in it and so much foolishness, I felt like I needed a blood transfusion. But everyone tried to convince me that it was "all in my head." I knew they were wrong because I felt it down in my soul. The thing that I remembered best about my father was his dropping by in my younger years to whip me for being so bad. As I grew a little older, he used me as his running partner to play with his girlfriend's kids while they were having sex in another room. Afterward, we would go back home to eat dinner with my momma. </p><p> As I matured into my adulthood, if that is what you want to call it, he taught me, "Never have one woman." He said that you have to "look at women as if they are a pair of shoes because if you have one on, you are going to feel as if you are crippled." And if one gets out of line, you have to whip her like she is a child. My father was an ignorant man, and half of my life I was ignorant because I lived by his laws. I asked him a question one day, "Why do cavemen drag their women by the hair?" He answered, "Because if you drag them by the feet, they will fill up with dirt." This fool raised me with this kind of thinking. That's why I ask you not to crucify me for what I've done, because I only learned what I was taught. As I branched out into my own world, I started following other players and womanizers, and learning each and every one of their traits, until I developed my own style of playing. That is what made me so dangerous, because I was made up of many different components of the game, with nothing standing in my way. They say, "Let your conscience be your guide." But I had no conscience, and the only thing that was guiding me was <i>my desires</i>. </p><p> I dated older women at a young age and younger women at an old age. I kept anywhere from six to ten women at a time. So when one would tell me that she was tired of me and was going to leave, it was always a pleasure and a relief. I would never do anything wrong to a woman who wanted to leave, but I would give her hell if she decided to stay. So many women wasted their valuable time thinking I would come around, not knowing at the time that was as far as I could go. No woman was safe around me, not my girlfriend's mother or her best friend. Once she entered my world, I was the wolf and she was the little lamb. </p><p> Who is the "New Boom"? He is a married family man who has learned how to talk to God and get results. They say, "Be careful what you ask God for." I asked Him for a God-like wife and family, and He gave me my soul mate and a lovely daughter. I asked Him for a little, and He gave me a lot. I asked Him for a "simple little thought," and it seems as if He gave me a brain transplant because I no longer think the same. I asked Him to help me care for others, and He replaced my heart. I asked Him to make me walk the right way, and He put pep in my step. I asked Him to help me speak to women in a positive way, and you are reading my words. So now you have it. That is why I call myself the Bodyguard for Women's Hearts. And I will live up to that title. That title is mine until the day I die! Out of all that I have done, right or wrong, there is one good thing that came out of all of this. I learned that keeping your word is one of the most important things you can learn. My word is my bond and God is my witness. Here I have given my word to you. </p><p> I was watching a TV program about boot camps for troubled teenagers. I am talking about the ones who raise all the hell in troubled neighborhoods. I am talking about little Ray Ray, and little Nuc Nuc, and the gang. They think that no one can change his life, and they are going to be gangbangers until the day they die. As soon as they got caught and had to go to a different environment, I saw them marching and saying, "Yes, sir," and making up the bed. Life does have a change for you; you just haven't witnessed it yet. Maybe it's because of those two words you never said: "can't" and " ain't." I know of one word that you can use and you'll never have to worry about a thing, and that is "Jesus." Jesus doesn't force you to do anything. He'll let you volunteer, and if you don't see Him when it is your time to go, you just bought a ticket to Hell. <b></b></p><p><b> It's Hard to Find a Man Who Will Tell the Truth. </b> </p><p> Some men stop me and say, "You are a traitor. You are giving up all of our secrets." I just say that the reason God put me on this assignment and not you is that women hear from fools every day, and every now and then they will find a man who will tell the truth. Finding a man who tells the truth is like looking for a dinosaur. When was the last time someone found a dinosaur? I want to tell the ladies that if you are going to play the game, remove your heart and let God hold it, and when you return, you'll be able to find them both in the same place. That is when you can begin your new life. <b></b></p><p><b> True Players Don't Mind This Book. </b> </p><p> One thing I have noticed is that the cool men are not mad at all for me writing this book. It bothers only the weak men, who had no game to begin with. True players don't have any problems with this, because there's plenty of game out there. A man can always think of another way to do it. On top of that, most women are not going to follow and listen to these instructions. Today you will, but right after this, it will be just like you left church. You can hear the pastor preach and shout all morning, and then you'll still go and have you an afternoon delight. </p><p> <b>Don't Hate the Player; Hate the Game.</b> </p><p> I am sitting here working out in the gym, and it just crossed my mind that I am tired of working on this treadmill. I see the same walls and equipment every day. But if I went outside and walked, the scenery would change. I would have fresh air and could walk as far as I wanted to. If a person comes out of his or her comfort zone and quits seeing the same thing every day, and travels and meets new people, it opens up a brand-new world. You'll discover that life won't be so boring. You will automatically change some things about yourself; the way you dress, the way you wear your hair. It could change the way you talk because you will have bigger and better things to talk about. That is just another one of my crazy thoughts! </p><p> Has your thunderstorm ever turned into a bright sunshiny day? Have you ever had something bad happen to you, and after it was over it seemed like it was a message getting you ready for the good things that were about to happen to you? All of a sudden the sun is shining on your life. The next time something bad happens to you, don't focus on the bad. Think about the blessings that are coming your way. It is like the song lyrics, "I can see clearly now, the rain is gone." </p><p> I am not trying to confuse anyone, but you will hear me say "suckah" and "player." They are similar, but there are differences. Suckahs have serious relationships and cheat on their women, while players don't want serious relationships because they just want to have as many women as possible. They are both trying to play the game. What makes the game different is what you bring to the table. Just look at it like you are at your job and it is potluck day. Everyone has to bring a dish of food. Just because you have a big bowl of potato salad, that doesn't make it a meal. Once everyone else brings their food, that is when it becomes a meal. It is the same thing with a suckah and a player: they are nothing without you. <b></b></p><p><b> My Darkest Secret. </b> </p><p> One of the ways I can make you believe I am telling the truth is to share one of my darkest secrets with you. See, I know if I tell you this, then you should trust me the rest of this journey because I am not trying to hide behind anything. I want you to know that I never read a book in my life because I was dyslexic. I want to try to get you to trust yourself and open up to the number one person, and that person is you, and be true to yourself. So with that being said I have to open up. I'm opening myself up to millions of people. The only way to open up to yourself is to change the way you think. I let the wrong people put negative thoughts in my head at a young age, and I just never tried after that. I just kept going through life trying to hide it. When you hide something at a young age, you keep doing it all your life and you end up an old person hiding the same thing that you could have fixed in your young life. So I'm asking you today to quit hiding stuff. Let's get together and try to work on something you can fix and quit being a slave to it. <b></b></p><p><b> Back When I Was Crazy. </b> </p><p> Folks would always say, "You are such a <i>bad</i> boy."

Is that how you would describe yourself?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I find that nothing makes people back away faster at a social gathering than "accordionist." Except perhaps "screenwriter." And, even "author" always makes people nervous, so I usually say "writer." <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> How long have you been writing?<br> <strong>A:</strong> All my life really, since I was <em>able</em> to write all I wanted to do was write. I think largely I ended up becoming a writer because I could think of nothing else that I was good at--at all. As a kid, I always wanted to be a writer, and I had no backup plan whatsoever as an adult.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Are the Baudelaire children ever going to be happy?<br> <strong>A:</strong> Well, they are happy on a regular basis, just not for very long. Um, are they ever going to be happy permanently? I don't know any permanently happy people, thank goodness.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Okay, then is the series going to end on a happy note?<br> <strong>A:</strong> Well, I always remind readers of the Snicket books that happy is a comparative term, so the end will be happier than some people would think, but less happy than others.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> When can fans expect the final book?<br> <strong>A:</strong> I believe the thirteenth volume will be released in the fall of 2006, although something terrible could happen to the author at any moment and then the books would not be released at all.<br><br> Looking for more from Daniel Handler?

What do they believe, and how did they take center stage in the American social and political consciousness?</b><br><br>From a loose movement that lurked in the shadows in the early 2000s, the alt-right has achieved a level of visibility that has allowed it to expand significantly throughout America&#x2019;s cultural, political, and digital landscapes. Racist, sexist, and homophobic beliefs that were previously unspeakable have become commonplace, normalized, and accepted&#x2014;endangering American democracy and society as a whole. Yet in order to dismantle the destructive movement that has invaded our public consciousness, we must first understand the core beliefs that drive the alt-right.<br><br>To help guide us through the contemporary moment, historian Alexandra Minna Stern excavates the alt-right memes and tropes that have erupted online and explores the alt-right&#x2019;s central texts, narratives, constructs, and insider language. She digs to the root of the alt-right&#x2019;s motivations: their deep-seated fear of an oncoming &#x201c;white genocide&#x201d; that can only be remedied through swift and aggressive action to reclaim white power. As the group makes concerted efforts to cast off the vestiges of neo-Nazism and normalize their appearance and their beliefs, the alt-right and their ideas can be hard to recognize. Through careful analysis, Stern brings awareness to the underlying concepts that guide the alt-right and animate its overlapping forms of racism, xenophobia, transphobia, and anti-egalitarianism. She explains the key ideas of &#x201c;red-pilling,&#x201d; strategic trolling, gender essentialism, and the alt-right&#x2019;s ultimate fantasy: a future where minorities have been removed and &#x201c;cleansed&#x201d; from the body politic and a white ethnostate is established in the United States. By unearthing the hidden mechanisms that power white nationalism, Stern reveals just how pervasive this movement truly is.</p><p><b>Alexandra Minna Stern</b> is the author of the award-winning <i>Eugenic Nation: Faults and Frontiers of Better Breeding in Modern America</i> and <i>Telling Genes: The Story of Genetic Counseling in America</i>. She has contributed her insight into eugenics, ethnicity, and social movements to dozens of scholarly essays and interviews.

Stern has fashioned an invaluable guide with which to unmask a new breed of racism.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Shelf Awareness</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Proud Boys and the White Ethnostate</i> is the definitive guide to alt-right ideas today. Stern brilliantly documents how a younger generation of activists are repackaging the Far Right, waging a battle for cultural dominance. The internet is their home, where they mix fascist ideologies and faux scholarship to make their case for white/Christian/male dominance. Stern has analyzed an enormous swath of ethno-nationalist material, sparing the rest of us from having to engage in that odious task. <i>Proud Boys</i> is essential reading in the age of Trump.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Arlene Stein, author of <i>Unbound: Transgender Men and the Remaking of Identity</i><br><br>&#x201c;In this carefully researched book, the historian Alexandra Minna Stern studies a wide array of online web sites, documenting a rise in claims to whiteness as a basis of identity, as a claim to victimhood and as an argument for a &#x2018;white ethnostate.&#x2019; Drawing ideas from films (&#x2018;red-pilling&#x2019; comes from <i>The Matrix</i>) and from the left (the need for &#x2018;safe spaces&#x2019;), the Alt-Right, she argues, is trying to normalize a frightening shift from talk of civic nationalism to talk of race-based nationalism. This is very important work we should all know about.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Arlie Hochschild, author of <i>Strangers in Their Own Land: Anger and Mourning on the American Right</i>, finalist for the National Book Award.<br><br>&#x201c;Timely, well-researched, and insightful, <i>Proud Boys and the White Ethnostate</i> is a brilliant study of the alt-right&#x2019;s beginnings and current attempts to push its message of racial separation, misogyny, white nationalism, and xenophobia into the American mainstream. It should be read in schools and book clubs across the nation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Leo R. Chavez, author of <i>The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Proud Boys and the White Ethnostate</i> lays bare the complex intellectual, theoretical, and political commitments of an ascendant alt-right and its use of culture, history, and identity to build power and win broad public consent. At its heart it is a sober warning about the ways that violence, patriarchy, and white supremacy continue to shape the American political imagination.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Daniel Martinez HoSang, coauthor of <i>Producers, Parasites, Patriots: Race and the New Right-Wing Politics of Precarity</i></p><h2>Pordy&#x2019;s Prickly Problem</h2><p>Pordy is a young porcupine who seems to be afraid of everything but when her mother is in trouble, Pordy must face her fears and try to help.</p><p><b>Janette Oke</b> pioneered inspirational fiction and is the leading author in the category today. <i>Love Comes Softly</i>, Janette's first novel, has sold over 1 million copies.

Here, Lieutenant Billy Prior is tormented by figuring out which side of several coins does he live -- coward or hero, crazy or sane, homosexual or heterosexual, upper class or lower.

Reissue.</p><p><b>Dean Koontz</b>,&nbsp;the author of many #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, lives in Southern California with his wife, Gerda, their golden retriever, Elsa, and the enduring spirit of their goldens, Trixie and Anna.Previously issued as a paperback original under the pseudonym Leigh Nichols, this is one of Koontz's better thrillers. Single parent Christine Scavello and her young son Joey find themselves confronted by a madwoman, Grace Spivey, who fancies she discerns the Antichrist in Joey's cherubic visage. Spivey is the charismatic leader of a religious cult whose fanatic members do her every bidding, including murdering the little boy, and everyone who stands in their way. After the police fail to provide adequate protection, Christine turns to private detective Charlie Harrison, whose business and home are soon firebombed by the cultists, and two of his men murdered, even as he finds that he is falling in love with Christine. The narrative moves along briskly until the last third, at which point a frantic chase sequence goes on too long. Nevertheless, this is a better than average adventure with supernatural overtones. The possibility of Joey's actually being the Antichrist is a deftly handled (and unresolved) tease. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Hitch-22: A Memoir</h2><p>#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author and finalist for the National Book Award&#x2014;one of the most admired and controversial public intellectuals of our time&#x2014;shares his personal life story.<br><br>Most who have observed Christopher Hitchens over the years would agree that he possesses a ferocious intellect and is unafraid to tackle the most contentious subjects. Now 60, English-born and American by adoption; all atheist and partly Jewish; bohemian (even listing "drinking" along with "disputation" as "hobbies" in <i>Who's Who</i>), he has held to a consistent thread of principle whether opposing war in Vietnam or supporting intervention in Iraq. As a foreign correspondent in some of the world's nastiest places, a lecturer and teacher and an esteemed literary critic, Hitchens manifests a style that is at once ironic, witty, and tough-minded. A legendary bon vivant with an unquenchable thirst for literature, he has sometimes ridiculed those who claim that the personal is political, though he has often seemed to illustrate that very idea. Readers will find that his own many opposites attract, as do his many sketches of friendship and ex-friendship, from Martin Amis to Noam Chomsky. Condemned to be able to see both sides of any argument, Christopher Hitchens has contradictions that contain their own multitudes.</p><p><p>CHRISTOPHER HITCHENS (1949-2011) was the author of the<i> New York Times</i> bestsellers god <i>Is Not Great</i>, <i>Hitch 22: A Memoir</i>, <i>Arguably: Essays</i>, and <i>Mortality</i>, among others.

(Salman Rushdie, commenting on my book <i>god Is Not Great</i>, remarked rather mordantly that the chief problem with its title was a lack of economy: that it was in other words exactly one word too long.)<br>&nbsp;<br>But whatever one&#x2019;s ontology may be, it will always seem tempting to believe that everything must have a first cause or, if nothing quite as grand as that, at the very least a definite beginning. And on that point I have no vagueness or indecision. I do know a little of how I came to be in two minds. And <i>this </i>is how it begins with me:<br>&nbsp;<br>I am standing on a ferry-boat that is crossing a lovely harbor. I have since learned many versions and variations of the word &#x201c;blue,&#x201d; but let&#x2019;s say that a brilliant if slightly harsh sunshine illuminates a cerulean sky-vault and an azure sea and also limns the way in which these two textures collide and reflect. The resulting tinge of green is in lambent contrast with the darker vegetation on the hillsides and makes an almost blinding combination when, allied with those discrepant yet melding blues, it hits the white buildings that reach down to the edge of the water. As a flash of drama and beauty and seascape and landscape, it&#x2019;s as good an inaugural memory as one could wish.<br>&nbsp;<br>Since this little voyage is occurring in about 1952 and I have been born in 1949, I have no means of appreciating that this is the Grand Harbor at Valletta, the capital of the tiny island-state of Malta and one of the finest Baroque and Renaissance cities of Europe. A jewel set in the sea between Sicily and Libya, it has been for centuries a place of the two-edged sword between the Christian and Muslim worlds. Its population is so overwhelmingly Roman Catholic that there are, within the walled city, a great plethora of ornate churches, the cathedral being decorated by the murals of Caravaggio himself, that seductive votary of the higher wickedness. The island withstood one of the longest Turkish sieges in the history of &#x201c;Christendom.&#x201d; But the Maltese tongue is a dialect version of the Arabic spoken in the Maghreb and is the only Semitic language to be written in a Latin script. If you happen to attend a Maltese Catholic church during Mass, you will see the priest raising the Communion Host and calling on &#x201c;Allah,&#x201d; because this after all is the local word for &#x201c;god.&#x201d; My first memory, in other words, is of a ragged and jagged, but nonetheless permeable and charming, frontier between two cultures and civilizations.<br>&nbsp;<br>I am, at this stage, far too secure and confident to register anything of the kind. (If I speak a few phrases of Maltese, it is not with a view to becoming bilingual or multicultural but in order to address my priest-ridden nannies and the kitchen maids with their huge broods of children. This was the place where I first learned to see the picture of Catholicism as one of plump shepherds and lean sheep.) * Malta is effectively a British colony &#x2014; its most heroic recent chapter the withstanding of a hysterical aerial bombardment by Hitler and Mussolini &#x2014; and it has remained a solid possession of the Royal Navy, in which my father proudly serves, ever since the Napoleonic Wars. Much more to the immediate point, I am standing on the deck of this vessel in company with my mother, who holds my hand when I desire it and also lets me scamper off to explore if I insist.<br>&nbsp;<br>* Everything about Christianity is contained in the pathetic image of &#x201c;the flock.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>So, all things being considered, not too shaky a start. I am well-dressed and well-fed, with a full head of hair and a slender waist, and operating in a context of startling architectural and natural beauty, and full of <i>brio </i>and self-confidence, and on a boat in the company of a beautiful woman who loves me.<br>&nbsp;<br>I didn&#x2019;t call her by this name at the time, but &#x201c;Yvonne&#x201d; is the echo with which I most piercingly and yearningly recall her memory to me. After all, it <i>was </i>her name, and it was what her friends called her, and my shell-like ear detected quite early on a difference between this and the various comfortable Nancys and Joans and Ethels and Marjories who &#x2014; sterling types all &#x2014; tended to be the spouses and helpmeets of my father&#x2019;s brother-officers. <i>Yvonne </i>. A bit of class there: a bit of style. A touch or dash of garlic and olive and rosemary to sweeten the good old plain English loaf from which, the fact must be faced, I was also sliced. But more of this when I come to Commander Hitchens. I mustn&#x2019;t pretend to remember more than I really do, but I am very aware that it makes a great difference to have had, in early life, a passionate lady in one&#x2019;s own corner.<br>&nbsp;<br>For example, noticing that I had skipped the baby-talk stage and gone straight to speaking in complete sentences (even if sometimes derivative ones such as, according to family legend, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s all go and have a drink at the club&#x201d;), she sat me down one day and produced an elementary phonetic reading-book, or what used to be known to the humble as &#x201c;a speller.&#x201d; This concerned the tedious adventures of a woodland elf or goblin called Lob-agob (his name helpfully subdivided in this way) but, by the time I was done with it, I was committed for life to having some sort of reading matter within reach at all times, and was always to be ahead of my class in reading-age.<br>&nbsp;<br>By this period, however, our family had left Malta and been posted to the much more austere surroundings of Rosyth, another naval base on the east coast of Scotland. I think Malta may have been a sort of high point for Yvonne: all British people were a cut above the rest in a semicolony and there was that club for cocktails and even the chance of some local &#x201c;help.&#x201d; Not that she longed to wallow in idleness but, having endured a girlhood of scarcity, slump, and then war, she couldn&#x2019;t have minded a bit of color and Mediterranean dash and may well have felt she&#x2019;d earned it. (On our way back from Malta we stopped for a few hours at Nice: her and my first taste of the Riviera. I remember how happy she looked.) The grayness and drabness of &#x201c;married quarters&#x201d; in drizzle-flogged Fifeshire must have hit her quite hard.<br>&nbsp;<br>But she and my father had first been thrown together precisely because of drizzle and austerity, and the grim, grinding war against the Nazis. He, a career Navy man, had been based at Scapa Flow, the huge, cold-water sound in the Orkney Islands which helped establish and maintain British control over the North Sea. She was a volunteer in the Women&#x2019;s Royal Naval Service or, in the parlance of the day, a &#x201c;Wren.&#x201d; (My most cherished photograph of her shows her in uniform.) After a short wartime courtship they had been married in early April 1945, not long before Adolf Hitler had shoved a gun into his own (apparently halitosis-reeking) mouth. One young and eager girl from a broken Jewish home in Liverpool, wed to one man twelve years her senior from a sternly united if somewhat repressed Baptist family in Portsmouth. Wartime was certainly full of such improvised unions, in which probably both at first counted themselves fortunate, but I know for a fact that while my father never stopped considering himself lucky, my mother soon ceased to do so. She also decided, for a reason that I believe I can guess, to engage in the not-so-small deception of not mentioning to anyone in the Hitchens family that she was of Jewish descent.<br>&nbsp;<br>She herself had wanted to &#x201c;pass&#x201d; as English after noticing some slight unpleasantness being visited on my grandmother, who in the 1930s toiled in the millinery business. And Yvonne could pass, too, as a light brunette with hazel-ish eyes and (always to my fancy and imagination) a &#x201c;French&#x201d; aspect. But more to the point, I now feel sure, she did not want either me or my brother to be taxed with <i>die Judenfrage </i>&#x2014; the Jewish question. What I do not know is quite what this concealment or reticence cost her. What I can tell you something about is what it meant for me.<br>&nbsp;<br>The paradox was this: in postwar Britain as in Britain at all other times, there was only one tried and tested form of social mobility. The firstborn son (at least) had to be educated at a private school, with an eventual view to attending a decent university. But school fees were high, and the shoals of class and accent and social position somewhat difficult for first-timers to navigate. Neither of my parents had been to college. One of my earliest coherent memories is of sitting in my pajamas at the top of the stairs, eavesdropping on a domestic argument. It was an easy enough one to follow. Yvonne wanted me to go to a fee-paying school. My father &#x2014; &#x201c;The Commander&#x201d; as we sometimes ironically and affectionately called him &#x2014; made the heavy but obvious objection that it was well beyond our means. Yvonne was having none of this. &#x201c;If there is going to be an upper class in this country,&#x201d; she stated with decision, &#x201c;then Christopher is going to be in it.&#x201d; I may not have the words exactly right &#x2014; could she have said &#x201c;ruling class&#x201d; or &#x201c;Establishment,&#x201d; terms that would then have been opaque to me? &#x2014; but the purport was very clear. And, from my hidden seat in the gallery, I silently applauded. Thus a further paradox discloses itself: my mother was much less British than my father but wanted above all for me to be an English gentleman. (You, dear reader, be the judge of how well <i>that </i>worked out.) And, though she wanted to keep me near, she needed to argue hotly for my sake that I be sent away.<br>&nbsp;<br>I registered this contradiction very acutely as, alternating between the beams and smiles of maternal encouragement and the hot tears of separation, she escorted me to my boarding school at the age of eight. I shall always be slightly sorry that I didn&#x2019;t make more of an effort to pretend that I was desolated, too. I knew I would miss Yvonne but I suppose by then I&#x2019;d had the essential experience of being loved without ever being spoiled. I was eager to get on with it. And at the school, which I had already visited as a prospective boarder, there could be found a library with shelves that seemed inexhaustible. There was nothing like that at our house, and Yvonne had taught me to love books. The cruelest thing I ever did, at the end of my first term away from home, was to come home for Christmas and address her as &#x201c;Mrs. Hitchens.&#x201d; I shan&#x2019;t forget her shocked face. It was the enforced etiquette to address all females at the school, from masters&#x2019; wives to staff, in this way. But I still suspect myself of having committed a mean little attention-getting subterfuge.<br>&nbsp;<br>This perhaps helps explain the gradual diminution of my store of memory of Yvonne: from the ages of eight to eighteen I was to be away from home for most of the year and the crucial rites of passage, from the pains of sexual maturity to the acquisition of friends, enemies, and an education, took place outside the bonds of family. Nonetheless, I always somehow knew how she was, and could generally guess what I didn&#x2019;t know, or what was to be inferred from between the lines of her weekly letters.<br>&nbsp;<br>My father was a very good man and a worthy and honest and hardworking one, but he bored her, as did much of the remainder of her life. &#x201c;The one unforgivable sin,&#x201d; she used to say, &#x201c;is to be boring.&#x201d; What she wanted was the metropolis, with cocktail parties and theater trips and smart friends and witty conversation, such as she had once had as a young thing in prewar Liverpool, where she&#x2019;d lived near Penny Lane and briefly known people like the madly gay Frank Hauser, later director of the Oxford Playhouse, and been introduced by a boyfriend to the work of the handsome Ulster poet Louis MacNeice, contemporary of Auden and author of <i>Autumn Journal </i>and (her favorite) <i>The Earth Compels </i>. What she got instead was provincial life in a succession of small English towns and villages, first as a Navy wife and then as the wife of a man who, &#x201c;let go&#x201d; by the Navy after a lifetime of service, worked for the rest of his days in bit-part jobs as an accountant or &#x201c;bursar.&#x201d; It is a terrible thing to feel sorry for one&#x2019;s mother or indeed father. And it&#x2019;s an additionally awful thing to feel this and to know the impotence of the adolescent to do anything at all about it. Worse still, perhaps, is the selfish consolation that it isn&#x2019;t really one&#x2019;s job to rear one&#x2019;s parents. Anyway, I knew that Yvonne felt that life was passing her by, and I knew that the money that could have given her the occasional glamorous holiday or trip to town was instead being spent (at her own insistence) on school fees for me and my brother, Peter (who had arrived during our time in Malta), so I resolved at least to work extremely hard and be worthy of the sacrifice.<br>&nbsp;<br>She didn&#x2019;t just sit there while I was away. She tried instead to become a force in the world of fashion. Perhaps answering the call of her milliner forebears, but at any rate determined not to succumb to the prevalent dowdiness of postwar Britain, she was forever involved in schemes for brightening the apparel of her friends and neighbors. &#x201c;One thing I <i>do </i>have,&#x201d; she used to say with a slightly defensive tone, as if she lacked some other qualities, &#x201c;is a bit of good taste.&#x201d; I personally thought she had the other qualities too: on those official holidays when parents would visit my boarding school and many boys almost expired in advance from the sheer dread of embarrassment, Yvonne never did, or wore, anything that I could later be teased about (and this was in the days when women still wore hats). She was invariably the prettiest and brightest of the mothers, and I could always kiss her gladly, right in front of everyone else, without any fear of mushiness, lipstick-stains, or other disasters. In those moments I would have dared anyone to tease me about her, and I was small for my age.<br>&nbsp;<br>However, the dress-shop business didn&#x2019;t go well. If it wasn&#x2019;t for bad luck, in fact, Yvonne would have had no luck at all. With various friends and partners she tried to float a store called Pandora&#x2019;s Box, I remember, and another called Susannah Munday, named for an ancestress of ours on the paternal Hampshire side. These enterprises just didn&#x2019;t fly, and I couldn&#x2019;t think why not except that the local housewives were just too drab and myopic and penny-pinching. I used to love the idea of dropping by as I went shopping, so that she could show me off to her friends and have a general shriek and gossip over some coffee, but I could always tell that business wasn&#x2019;t good. With what a jolt of recognition did I read, years later, V.S. Naipaul&#x2019;s uncanny diagnosis of the situation in <i>The Enigma of Arrival </i>. He was writing about Salisbury, which was close enough to Portsmouth:<br>&nbsp;<br>A shop might be just two or three minutes&#x2019; walk from the market square, but could be off the main shopping track.

This debut thriller--the first in a trilogy from the late Stieg Larsson--is a serious page-turner rivaling the best of Charlie Huston and Michael Connelly. Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really <em>don't</em> want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo. --<em>Dave Callanan</em><br><br>Stieg Larsson was the editor in chief of the magazine <i>Expo</i>.

Who is more worthy of respect than a brave man in misfortune&#39;? When &#34;Henry Esmond&#34; appeared in 1852, noted writers and critics of the time acclaimed it as the best historical novel ever written. Set in the reign of Queen Anne, the story follows the troubled progress of a gentleman and an officer in Marlborough&#39;s army, as he painfully wrestles with an emotional allegiance to the old Tory-Catholic England until, disillusioned, he comes to terms of a kind with the Whiggish-Protestant future. This change also entails a very uncomfortable switch in his affections. The love story of Henry Esmond is charged with sombre, unconscious emotions, yet is skilfully embedded into historical events which are convincing but never too prominent.</p><p>William Makepeace Thackeray was born in Calcutta in 1811, but sent to England at the age of six. He was educated at Charterhouse and at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1833 he settled in Paris, after a major financial loss, and tried a career as a painter. It was here he met nineteen-year-old Isabella Shawe, upon whom he based many of his virtuous but weak heroines, and whom he married in 1836. A year later they settled in London, where Thackeray turned seriously to journalism. His writing for periodicals included The Yellowplush Correspondence, which appeared first in Fraser&#39;s Magazine and then in 1841 in book form. Around this time personal and domestic pressures caused the already helpless Isabella to subside into a state of complete and permanent mental collapse and the subsequent breakdown of the marriage formed a central part of Thackeray&#39;s consciousness. His early work centred around rogues and villains, most famously in The Luck of Barry Lyndon (1844; revised as The Memoirs of Barry Lyndon, Esq. in 1856), and in his masterpiece, Vanity Fair, which appeared in monthly parts in 1847-8 and which most clearly reveals his socially satirical edge. The Book of Snobs, which originally appeared as a series in Punch, also attacks Victorian society with vicious wit. Thackeray&#39;s later novels include The History of Pendennis, (1848-50); The History of Henry Esmond, Esq. (1852); The Newcomes (1853-5); The Virginians, (1857-9), which is a sequel to Henry Esmond; and The Adventures of Philip (1860-62). He also wrote a series of lectures, The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century (1853), and numerous reviews, articles and sketches, usually in the comic vein. From 1860 to 1862 he also edited the Cornhill magazine. Thackeray died suddenly on Christmas Eve, 1863.Out of modesty, one supposes, the impossibly virtuous (and fictional) Henry Esmond narrates his adventures in the third person. Raised to believe himself a nobleman's love-child, he eventually discovers he is a legitimate heir. This knowledge he suppresses in favor of his near relations and benefactors, especially the Jacobite Lady Castlewood and her daughter, both of whom he loves devotedly, and one of whom he eventually marries. In the meantime, neither he nor his kin can escape the political, martial, and religious turmoil of Queen Anne's England. Published in 1852, this novel helped establish Thackeray as Charles Dickens's rival in popularity. Narrator Gordon Griffin, who has previously tackled both, here displays an enthusiastic sincerity that contributes much charm to his deep understanding of the tone and milieu of this novel. Though seeming to downplay the melancholy that seeps into the prose, he manages to convey it without letting it overwhelm the vigor of the writing.

The first two volumes of this work appeared in Jaspers's lifetime; the third and fourth have been culled from the vast material of his posthumous papers. This is the third volume; the fourth is to be published in 1994.<br>In the present volume, which follows his original plan of "promoting the happiness that comes of meeting great men and sharing in their thoughts," Jaspers discusses the Metaphysicians: Xenophanes, Empedocles, Democritus, Bruno, Epicurus, Boehme, Schelling, and Leibniz. Then he turns to the Creative Orderers: Aristotle and Hegel. His method is personal, one of constant questioning and struggle, as he enters into dialogue with his "eternal contemporaries," the thinkers of the past. For Jaspers believes that it is only through communication with others that we come to ourselves and to wisdom.</p><p>The German Jaspers was engaged in a comprehensive summary of the world's philosophers when he died in 1969, but he left the essentials in place. The volumes of his "universal history of philosophy," of which this is the third (the fourth is due next year), furnish the public library a nonephemeral acquisition that is a bit more elevated than the work of the middlebrow Durants. Jaspers lines up 10 famous philosophers--beginning with Aristotle, that obsessive systematizer who sorted everything with various degrees of modern permanence: rhetoric (up-to-date); politics (ditto); physics (not); and biology (doubly not). Epicurus, the expounder of hedonism, follows, and so completely dominates this particular outlook that his live-for-the-day disciples really have nothing to add, as long as they assert no extracorporeal existence for the soul. That opinion originated with the inventor of the atomic concept, Democritus, and such Being versus Nothingness metaphysics overarches the rest of Jaspers' profiles. In sentence after weighty sentence--and Jaspers writes very austerely--the seeker can at least recognize that behind the opacity of Hegel and Leibniz's thought lies the question that afflicts every human: What on earth am I doing here? <i>Gilbert Taylor</i>Scrutinizing 10 philosophers from Epicurus to Hegel, Jaspers, the famed German existentialist (1883-1969), extracts the living essence of each philosopher's wisdom in these higly individualistic critiques. For Jaspers, Giordano Bruno, the Italian wandering scholar burnt at the stake by the Inquisition, is the founder of modern pantheism, while Democritus, the ancient Greek atomist, showed that "it is possible to live, without God, in tranquillity, serene and active." Jaspers also discusses the egalitarianism of philosophical poet Xenophanes; Empedocles as a self-styled prophet and savior; Aristotle's pursuit of truth through the intellect; religious mystic Jakob Boehme; and the systems of Leibniz and Schelling.

Wright's integration of architecture and landscape, Kahn's dramatic yet humane monumentality, and Mies's austere elegance are revealed and preserved in Stoller's classic compositions. Small, elegant, and affordable, each volume presents the photo-graphs that made these structures famous. With 60 rich duotone plates (and 16 color plates for Taliesin West), a brief introduction, and newly drawn plans, sections, and elevations, these books constitute the essential photographic histories of the most important works of modernism.</p><p>Ezra Stoller is one of the preeminent architectural photographers in the world and the founder of the renowned Esto architectural photography studio.Ezra Stoller is the Annie Leibovitz of modern architecture. <strong><i>House &amp; Garden </i></strong><br><br> This is one of a series of small photo books (5 1/2 x 7 1/2 ) presenting the masterworks of modern architecture through the lens of Ezra Stoller. For 60 years, Stoller has been revered by architects, editors, collectors, and photographers for his ability to translate an architect's vision into two dimensions. This is architectural photography at its finest. For anyone interested in photographing buildings, there is a wealth of information in Stoller's images, particularly his interiors. Each volume has an introduction by a prominent architectural writer, drawings and plans, a key to the photos, and a note form Stoller about how he came to photograph the building, as well as some of the difficulties he encountered. <strong><i>Popular Photography</i></strong></p><h2>A Perfect Time for Pandas</h2><p>FAST SHIPPING</p><p></p><h2>Land of a Thousand Hills: My Life in Rwanda</h2><p>A first-hand chronicle of the Rwandan genocide marks a native New Yorker&#39;s account of her years lived in Africa, as she discusses her friendship with Dian Fossey, her perspective on the fall of colonialism and African civil wars, and more. 17,500 first printing.</p><p>If you enjoyed <i>Out of Africa</i> and <i>West with the Night</i>, here's another amazing woman's story of her adventurous African life. Rosamond Halsey Carr left her job as a young New York City fashion illustrator in the 1940s to join her hunter-explorer husband in the Belgian Congo; after their divorce, she decided to stay on in neighboring Rwanda as the manager of a flower plantation. For the next 50 years she lived an extraordinary life, witnessing the fall of colonialism, the loss of her friend Dian Fossey, and the relentless clashes between the Hutus and the Tutsis. Although this book includes a poignant insider's account of the events surrounding the horrific 1994 genocide, it also provides a beautiful portrait of the Rwanda that was--and still is. After being evacuated during the genocide, Carr returned to Rwanda and, at age 82, rebuilt her home from the ground up, intent on opening a home for some 100 orphaned children. <p> Carr's humble tenacity and bold strength animate her historical, cultural, and personal accounts. Arriving in Africa in 1949, she witnesses the traditions of the royal Tutsi dynasty, sails up the Congo to camp in pygmy villages, encounters leopards, mingles with European aristocrats, finds and loses love, and lives through Congo independence and civil war. Her passion for the country and its people makes for a life story that is both tragic and hopeful, and full of interesting details that animate the spirit of Rwanda. <i>--Kathryn True</i></p><b>Rosamond Halsey Carr</b> is the last of the foreign plantation owners in Rwanda, where she now runs a children's orphanage. She has been featured on television programs from <b>The Today Show</b> to CNN to the BBC.</p><h2>Dorling Kindersley Science Encyclopedia</h2><p>A thematically arranged encyclopedia integrates lively articles on a wide range of scientists and scientific subjects, cross-referenced and corroborated by a science education specialist, with more than two thousand photographs, maps, diagrams, and charts.</p><p>What fits in your pocket yet holds the continents, the oceans, and all the stars? The <i>Pocket Science Encyclopedia</i>! This small but sturdy volume is organized into four main themed categories: "Chemistry and Physics," "Earth and Weather," "Space," and "The Living World." In these categories are more than 200 two-page entries on more detailed subjects, like "Explosive Volcanoes," "Life Cycle of a Star," and "Simple Invertebrates." To supplement the text information, more than 1,000 photos, illustrations, and diagrams help readers understand even the most difficult scientific topic. This is <i>the</i> book to take on a field trip, vacation, or visit to the boring relatives' house, because it's filled with great tidbits and stuff to investigate. For a bigger, stay-at-home version of this fact-packed little encyclopedia, <i>The DK Science Encyclopedia</i> can't be beat. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Grade 4-8-Either one of these titles makes a practical alternative to the recent flood of multivolume surveys-the Macmillan Encyclopedia of Science (Macmillan, 1991), the New Book of Popular Science (Grolier, 1990), etc. Both are up to date, hasty but accurate, and the products of about a dozen authors. Both combine crisp, brightly colored illustrations with unintimidating blocks of text printed in various sizes and styles, boxed sidebars and capsule biographies, cross-references, and indexes. In the Dorling Kindersley volume, technical terms, as well as the charts, tables, and formulas, have settled into a large appendix. The articles are not recycled from the "Eyewitness" books, although many cover the same territory; they are arranged in procrustean, 30-page, topical groups ("Weather" and "Living Things" receive the same amount of space), written in a breezy style, and supported by plenty of photos and paintings. The scattershot page design favors browsing over sustained study, but the book's now-familiar look will be appealing to readers less practiced in the research arts. Besides considerably greater length (it was originally published in several volumes in 1991), the Kingfisher title offers information in the more traditional alphabetical arrangement, with one to four articles per page. Though less profusely illustrated than Dorling Kindersley, the pictures are often more telling: dramatic photos of a tree killed by "Acid Rain" or a bullet blasting through a raw egg (for "Velocity") punctuate lucid painted figures, sequences, and schema. Frequent "See For Yourself" boxes contain directions for homemade science demonstrations, though they are not indexed, and, caveat emptor!, many are potentially risky, especially since all safety cautions are relegated to a page in the front. Readers with quick or specific questions will find the Kingfisher easier to use, but the Dorling Kindersley presents a more connected view of science's interrelationships.<br><i>John Peters, NYPL</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Night and Day: A Play</h2><p>The provocative and funny look at exploitation and corruption, journalistic ethics, freedom of the press and marital infidelity is set in a fictional copper rich African nation.

Aware of the risks involved, but determined to explore what he could of the Afghan people and culture, Elliot leaves the relative security of Kabul. He travels by foot and on horseback, and hitches rides on trucks that eventually lead him into the snowbound mountains of the North toward Uzbekistan, the former battlefields of the Soviet army's "hidden war." Here the Afghan landscape kindles a recollection of the author's life ten years earlier, when he fought with the anti-Soviet mujaheddin resistance during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. </p><p>Weaving different Afghan times and visits with revealing insights on matters ranging from antipersonnel mines to Sufism, Elliot has created a narrative mosaic of startling prose that captures perfectly the powerful allure of a seldom-glimpsed world.</p></p><p><b>Jason Elliot</b> lives in London. <i>An Unexpected Light</i> is his first book.<p>&#x201c;The most sustained firsthand description of life in Afghanistan to be produced by a foreign observer in recent years . . . exciting.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Bernstein, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;A work of substance and style, witty and moving by turns, never less than wholly passionate . . .

I loved this book.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;This extraordinary debut is an account of Elliot's two visits to Afghanistan. The first occurred when he joined the mujaheddin circa 1979 and was smuggled into Soviet-occupied Afghanistan; the second happened nearly ten years later, when he returned to the still war-torn land. The skirmishes that Elliot painstakingly describes here took place between the Taliban and the government of Gen. Ahmad Shah Massoud in Kabul. Today, the Taliban are in power, but Elliot's sympathies clearly lie with Massoud. Although he thought long and hard before abandoning his plan to travel to Hazara territory, where 'not a chicken could cross that pass without being fired on,' Elliot traveled widely in the hinterland, visiting Faizabad in the north and Herat in the west. The result is some of the finest travel writing in recent years. With its luminous descriptions of the people, the landscape (even when pockmarked by landmines), and Sufism, this book has all the hallmarks of a classic, and it puts Elliot in the same league as Robert Byron and Bruce Chatwin.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>An Unexpected Light</i> is often unexpectedly funny and constantly perceptive, but it is also profound.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jason Goodwin, The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Elliot is an enthralling writer with a great gift for evoking places, people and atmosphere, from the pastoral calm of a fertile valley to the terrifying sights and sounds of war.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Merle Rubin, The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Lyrical . . . alluring . . . a poignant remembrance, hued in the mixed reds of war and sunset, that comes close to a place that has already changed beyond imagination.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Paula Newberg, San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Humorous, honest and wry . . .

Naturalist Susan Shetterly looks at how animals, humans, and plants share the land&#x2015;observing her own neighborhood in rural Maine. She tells tales of the locals (humans, yes, but also snowshoe hares, raccoons, bobcats, turtles, salmon, ravens, hummingbirds, cormorants, sandpipers, and spring peepers). She expertly shows us how they all make their way in an ever-changing habitat. <br><br>In writing about a displaced garter snake, witnessing the paving of a beloved dirt road, trapping a cricket with her young son, rescuing a fledgling raven, or the town's joy at the return of the alewife migration, Shetterly issues warnings even as she pays tribute to the resilience that abounds.&nbsp; <br><br>Like the works of Annie Dillard and Aldo Leopold, <i>Settled in the Wild</i> takes a magnifying glass to the wildness that surrounds us. With keen perception and wit, Shetterly offers us an education in nature, one that should inspire us to preserve it.<br></p><p>Susan Hand Shetterly is the author of the essay collections <i>Settled in the Wild</i> and <i>The New Year&#x2019;s Owl,</i> as well as several children&#x2019;s books including <i>Shelterwood</i>, named an Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children by the Children&#x2019;s Book Council. Shetterly has received a nonfiction writing grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and two grants from the Maine Arts Commission. &nbsp;Starred Review. I live on land that has not surrendered the last of its wildness, Shetterly (<i>The New Year's Owl: Encounters with Animals, People and the Land They Share</i>) writes of her home in rural Maine. It keeps secrets, and those secrets prompt us to pay attention, to look for more. In her first essay collection in more than 20 years, she beautifully renders some of what she's learned in the decades since she and her then husband moved into an unfinished cabin&#x2014;idealistic, dangerously unprepared, and, frankly, arrogant, she can see now. Most of these essays, however, focus on life after she's settled in, when she's learned to listen for the sounds of the coming spring through her open bedroom window or impulsively stands down a bobcat that's chased a baby rabbit into the middle of the road. Shetterly's eye for poetic detail is exquisite, especially in longer essays such as the story of how she nursed an injured raven back to health, after which it set up home on her roof and became best friends with her terrier. But she writes about her neighbors (even those she admits she never really knew) with equal grace and empathy. Let's hope it's not another quarter-century before her next collection arrives. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her story's a doozy! It goes way back to Epossumondas's great-great-grandpa, Papapossum.

The acclaimed picture book <i>Epossumondas</i> is her variation on the traditional Southern tale Epaminondas, which has been her trademark story for decades.

They're baaaaack--that silly, diapered Epossumondas and Mama in her flowered dress and yellow hat (Stevens' affectionate visual tribute to well-known storyteller Salley). This time Epossumondas is thinking about tails: skunks have black-and-white ones; foxes have bushy, red ones; and hares have powder-puff ones. But Epossumondas' tail is long, naked, and pink. How come? Mama tells him a story. A long time ago, great-great-grandpa Papapossum had a fluffy tail. One day hungry Papapossum meets Hare, who convinces him to climb Bear's persimmon tree and throw down some of the persimmons. But when Papapossum gobbles up more than he throws down, Hare gets angry and tells Bear, who chases Papapossum and catches him in a tail tug-of-war. And since then "no possum has ever had hair on his tail." Stevens' signature mixed-media illustrations humorously concoct the delightful fun with such clever touches as Papapossum's persimmon-patterned shirt. This laughable stretch of the imagination, a tale about a tail by a natural-born storyteller, may be even more entertaining than the rollicking <i>Epossumondas</i> (2002). <i>Julie Cummins</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Perhaps for the "voyeur's rush" he feels on surveillance jobs? Readers, for their part, will experience little of that high as Thompson relates the "hugger-mugger stuff" (his wife's phrase) of his work during 1978-88: a palimony suit involving a gay podiatrist, murder in Chinatown, domestic-estrangement capers, a trip to India on a child-custody case. With nods to Kierkegaard's "despair of finitude" and to the "detectivery and shadowy" ideal of "St. Dashiell" (Hammett), he shows us a philosopher "dicking around as a detective" and becoming so pleased with himself that he makes his new career permanent. Readers can only wonder at his misreading of Soren and Dash. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.While on a sabbatical, Thompson, Haverford College professor of philosophy, took a job as a private investigator in the San Francisco area. In this book, he narrates his experiences on several cases, during which he confronted himself and his concept of morality. He tells of auto repossession, murder, child snatching in India, and recovering $30,000 for an accused drug smuggler. Occasionally philosophical, at times introspective, Thompson uses Dashiell Hammett's fictional Sam Spade as his measure. Lack of continuity and suspense tarnish what could have been a fascinating firsthand account.

Bittman's dishes draw on the world's cuisines and, taken together, represent what might be called a new kind of home cooking. Anyone seeking delicious everyday food that's quick to put on the table yet satisfies the demands of modern palates should embrace the book. In succinct chapters that cover the major dish categories, salads through desserts, Bittman offers fare like Roast Cod with Tangerine Sauce, Chicken Under a Brick, Real Paella, and 15-Minute Fruit Gratin. These approachable, flexible dishes should enter the repertoire of cooks at all skill levels, as well as please those they feed. Bittman also includes recipes that illustrate a particular cooking technique or sequence; his Creamy Broccoli Soup, for example, presents a formula--three parts liquid, two parts vegetable, one part dairy--that can be applied widely to create new dishes instinctively. Cooking lessons like these, plus shortcuts and multiple suggestions for flavorful variations, make the book particularly useful. With photos that illustrate a number of the techniques, and recipe notes that further explore dish anatomy, the book delivers on its promise to provide strategies for good eating with little fuss. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i>"Minimalism in cooking is what every cook dreams of but rarely manages to achieve.

I must have inherited my taste for working the land, and my love of flowers, from my mother, Edilia, a florist.<br><br>Though my sister and my brothers are interested in the natural world too, I am the only one of us who makes a living from it. My sister, Claudia, the oldest of my siblings, works in a Spanish version of Harrods. My older brother Falo, who was a salesman, sadly died five years ago. Another brother, Miguel, is a truck driver, and another, Javi, runs a small music club. I am the youngest. Like any large family, we have a range of talents&#x2014;there&#x2019;s the sporty one, the artistic one, the musician, the naturalist. I have always been able to learn something from them, and from my uncles, aunties, and cousins too. I have definitely been shaped by the interests, passions, and fears of our tribe.<br><br>My mother was nine at the start of the Spanish Civil War, and her family suffered greatly. There were often insurrections in Astur���ias. In 1934 there was a miners&#x2019; strike, when the anarcho-�syndicalists declared themselves independent from Spain. It developed into a revolutionary uprising that was crushed by General Franco, who deployed Moorish troops to do so. Today the uprising is often considered to be the prelude to the Spanish Civil War, which itself is often considered to be the spark that ignited the Second World War, so it could be argued that the Second World War started in Asturias too.<br><br>The civil war had a massive impact on people&#x2019;s lives, as bitter lines were drawn between Republicans and Fascists. It was even fought within families: you could end up shooting your uncle, or your father, without realizing it. My mother lived in torment from the age of nine to about thirteen, and in the �post-�war period there was heavy rationing and a �right-�wing Catholic dictatorship to endure. Then war exploded again, this time throughout the rest of Europe. These were not ideal circumstances for any young girl or boy to grow up in.<br><br>After the civil war, she and her seven brothers and sisters worked the land, but the food was taken by the state and they had little left for themselves. My grandfather used to grow a small amount of tobacco, and he hid it in the maize fields so that the army wouldn&#x2019;t confiscate it, but they always somehow found out.<br><br>It was hard for the family: they had very little food and barely any resources. Everyone had to be �self-�sufficient, but not in the modern, fashionable sense of the word&#x2014;this was for real. It was the only way they could survive.<br><br>Franco and his supporters had a fascinating attitude toward nature. They wanted to homogenize the country and eradicate anything that threatened productivity. In previous centuries, people had felled large expanses of ancient oak forest in Asturias and other regions in northern Spain, some of the most biodiverse places in Europe. Much of this wood was used to construct the galleons that first reached the Americas and then went on to form the &#x201c;invincible armada&#x201d; of the Spanish navy. Franco continued logging these rich native forests, and made the problem worse by replacing native species with rows and rows of eucalyptus and pines. It was like an ethnic cleansing of nature.<br><br>As a consequence, even today, Spain catches fire every summer. The state blames it on people having barbecues or throwing cig�arettes from their car. Is it their fault, though? Or is it the fault of Franco and company, who destroyed the richly diverse flora and fauna and planted highly flammable vegetation instead? There is now a movement to clear out the eucalyptus and replace them with native species, but it is hugely expensive and you have to remove every single eucalyptus stump because the trees regrow vigorously when coppiced.<br><br>Many villages, including San Esteban de D�riga, where my mother lived, were surrounded by forests that had been there since the Iron Age. You could keep bees there, harvest berries and mushrooms, graze your cows and goats. These native forests were a useful resource to the whole community, year after year. You couldn&#x2019;t &#x201c;slash and burn&#x201d; the whole lot, but you could cut down a tree and bring it into the village for your own use.<br><br>Franco, however, wanted to populate the whole of Spain, and put everything to practical use. Any animal that did not produce a profit was vermin and had to be destroyed. People would go out shooting in the forest, put the &#x201c;unproductive&#x201d; dead bears and wolves in a car trunk, then go to the town center and show them for a government fee. Records for the whole of Spain show that in 1969, 150 bears were killed. By the 1980s, when I was a kid, there were only eighty left.<br><br>These records make for sobering reading.1 From 1944 to 1961, the total number of birds, mammals, and reptiles killed in Spain was tallied at 655,010. Among them were 1,206 golden eagles, 11,105 black kites, 47,739 ravens, 2,278 choughs, 103,322 magpies, 1,961 wolves, and 10,896 snakes.<br><br>Poisoning was by far the most destructive method. Vultures suffered because people would put out meat laced with strychnine as bait for other animals, and their corpses, which the vultures fed on, would become toxic too. They forgot that vultures stopped the spread of disease (if a cow dies of contagious bovine tuberculosis, for example, vultures will pick the bones clean, preventing the disease from spreading to other animals). Perhaps people thought that God made the land and the vermin so we could kill them for entertainment.<br><br>Although Franco&#x2019;s policies drastically reduced the numbers of wild animals, thankfully none resulted in mass extinction.<br><br>Yet we have not learned from our mistakes. Even today, farmers demand that the authorities keep killing wolves, even though when this is done in a random way it is detrimental to farming. Breaking up wolf packs causes even more damage to farmers, since lone wolves are more likely to attack livestock, which are easy prey. And most of the damage attributed to wolves is actually caused by wild dogs, which, in turn, are one of the wolves&#x2019; favorite prey. Funny, that.<br><br>Hearing these stories when I was young made me aware of the importance of ecosystems and how vital it is to conserve animals and plants. I became interested in politics and started to realize that the wanton destruction of nature was part of the folly of man.<br><br>Sandwiched between the Cantabrian Mountains and the sea, Asturias is one of the most rewarding places on earth&#x2014;if you are into natural history. It is about thirty miles wide at one end, and about twelve at the other, and the topography is steep. Rivers tumble straight down from the mountains into the sea. You can be at 1,500 miles above sea level, looking at the rugged mountain scenery, yet only about twenty miles from the sea. Among the peaks there are waterfalls and several glacial lakes. It is one of the few places that openly display the geological history of the earth, from the day when the first molten rock solidified. In one place there are dinosaur footprints; in another, mounds of coral fossils, or fern fossils in carbon deposits.<br><br>Asturias is an unbelievable place for wildlife&#x2014;the perfect place to learn about nature as a child. There are about seventy protected areas (landscapes, natural reserves, and national natural monuments), and the first national park ever declared in Spain, the Picos de Europa National Park. The jagged limestone mountains of the Picos de Europa define the eastern part of the region. They are intricate, with steep, narrow valleys and gorges, sometimes running north to south, then suddenly east to west. It is like a corrugated fingerprint of valleys, so a valley that is two and a half miles away in a straight line might be six miles away by road. What&#x2019;s more, Asturias boasts the largest patch of primary deciduous forest in Europe, the last viable population of brown bears and the largest wolf population in Western Europe, not to mention the greatest densities of otters, boars, and chamois on the continent.<br><br>Near to where I spent my childhood are the River Nal�n and its main tributary, the River Narcea. The Nal�n drainage system flows from the mountains through pristine forest and is teeming with salmon and aquatic wildlife (sometimes I think that I am like a salmon, born in the northern Spanish rivers and migrating to �England). I call the Nal�n the Amazon of Asturias. Just as the Amazon has its Rio Negro (Black River), so too did the Nal�n: when I was a child, the waters in the �mid-�lower course of the river were like dark chocolate, it was so heavily polluted with charcoal washings from the charcoal production there, but a program to restore the water quality has helped enormously.<br><br>The village where my mother was raised, San Esteban de D�riga, near the River Narcea, had only about thirty inhabitants when she was growing up. It is surrounded by forests, hedgerows, and apple orchards, and although it is part of Spain, it is far from �sun-�bleached: Asturias has almost double the annual rainfall of London.<br><br>Asturias was the kind of place where people would work together for the benefit of the community. If there was a road to be built or the forest needed clearing to stop forest fires, everyone joined forces and gave their time for nothing. I am sure life in Britain was once like this too. The traditions and landscape of Asturias, with its corners of almost untouched land, deeply affected my attitude toward wild habitats and their conservation.<br><br>About twenty miles from where I lived was an industrial town called Avil�s. It was, and still is, highly polluted and was recently claimed to be the most polluted town in Spain. When I was young, you could smell the town five miles before you reached it, and if you were unlucky enough to have to go there, you always ended up with streaming eyes or a hacking cough. In 1980, a report in the newspaper El Pa�s stated that six out of ten people seen in the local hospital emergency room were there because of respiratory problems such as chronic bronchitis.<br><br>It seemed incredible that you could have both of these scenarios within twenty miles of each other. On one hand, there was rich biodiversity, wildlife, and rugged scenery, and on the other an industrial, polluting nightmare, suffocating the life around it. All that was good and bad on the earth was there. Having seen both up close, I knew which side I wanted to choose.<br><br>By the time I was five, I was looking after the plants at school and had become the authority on natural history for my friends. If I didn&#x2019;t know the answers to their questions I would go home and ask my mother or look in books until I found out. When I was older, I read all six �volumes of an encyclopedia called Natural Science, from cover to cover&#x2014;twelve times. As they were expensive, my father said I should read them only if I rested them on a table, but I would take them to the bathroom, lock myself in, and sit there for hours. My family still has them.<br><br>Natural history soon became my sole passion and interest. I knew the names of all the fish in our aquarium, the birds that flew around the town, and the plants in the fields and surrounding streets. Back then we didn&#x2019;t have the same focus on television and social media as children do now; to keep ourselves entertained we played with our dogs or looked after parrots or exotic birds or went walking in the surrounding countryside. I learned how to care for my pets, looked up the places where they came from, and studied how they lived. We had an En�glish canary called Manolito. He sang so loudly that at lunchtime we had to cover his cage with a cloth&#x2014;it was the only way you could hear yourself talk. I also kept exotic birds such as Speke&#x2019;s weavers, �cut-�throat finches, and an American northern cardinal (which was probably my favorite). My father built a large aviary in the orchard of our finca&#x2014;Spanish for a rural or agricultural piece of land, usually with a cottage. And from then on the list of birds and pets grew and grew. In the end I had so many pets that my parents imposed a ban on anymore feathery or furry family members.<br><br>A man named F�lix Rodr�guez de la Fuente was my hero. He was a medical doctor and was into hunting and rural pursuits, so he understood nature&#x2014;to catch something, you have to understand the ways of your prey. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, he and a few English people resurrected the art of falconry in Spain, mostly using medieval books. In 1975, he became the presenter of a natural history program called El Hombre y la Tierra (The Man and the Earth). In this show he would do things like raise a goshawk, and also find a pair that was nesting, then combine shots of the trained bird with sequences of those in the wild, so viewers could compare how these birds lived and caught their prey. He also raised a pack of wolf cubs and trained them as hunting dogs, so if he wanted to film a pack of wolves chasing a deer he could release them and accurately predict where they would go, sometimes over several miles, positioning cameras along the route to film them as they ran. In much the same style as David Attenborough, he was an incredible narrator&#x2014;intense, dramatic, and almost poetic at times. The funky psychedelic music that accompanied the images only intensified my love for the show.<br><br>My mother said that from as young as two years old, I would be asleep in bed, but as soon as the show&#x2019;s music started I would come crawling from my room and sit on the floor in front of the television, transfixed. I was a fan for many years. When people asked my friends, brothers, and sister what they wanted to be when they grew up, their answers ranged from a football player to a bullfighter to a fireman&#x2014;sometimes even a general. I didn&#x2019;t know the word to describe the job F�lix Rodr�guez de la Fuente did, but I wanted to be just like him (and I still do).<br><br>Some of the images he created were unbeatable. I don&#x2019;t think that even Attenborough and the BBC had produced anything like them at that time. He mixed poetic descriptions and surrealism with scientific information. Because he knew animal psychology, he could anticipate what they would do. He would put carrion in the flight path of an eagle, with cameras focused on critical points, knowing that at some point the eagle would see the prey and pick it up and he could film what happened in detail.</p><h2>Goran&#39;s Great Escape</h2><p><p>It's a beautiful, sunny Easter Sunday in Sweden.

Her most famous book, Pippi Longstocking, was published in 1945 to great success. She is also well known for Karlsson on the Roof, her books about The Bullerby Children and The Tomten. Her books are loved all over the world and have sold around 145 million copies. She won many awards, including the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award for Pippi Longstocking in 1973; the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1958; and the International Book Award from UNESCO in 1993. Marit T�rnqvist was born in 1964 in Uppsala, Sweden and divides her time between the Netherlands and Sweden. She studied illustration at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam.

Herman attempts to right the balance unset by panicky prognosticators who either decry the defeat of Western values or herald the bankruptcy of Enlightenment idealism, despite the unparalleled worldwide ascendance of market economics, universal human rights, and representational, constitutional government. <p> Herman is at his best when making erudite replies to today's ill-informed peddlers of doom and gloom. But when he starts attempting to trace the history of "declinism," to philosophers from Frederick Neitzche to Martin Heidegger, and writers from Henry Adams to Robert Bly, his accusations often fall wide of the intended mark. His assaults on Jean Jacques Rousseau and W.E.B. DuBois will appear particularly unfair to those familiar with the works of these men, though readers who trust in Herman's abbreviated accounts of their thinking will be unknowingly misled. The "Great Ideas" framework Herman defends in the pages of this book ought to prize the close reading of important texts as much as it seeks to protect a sacrosanct canon or a static notion of prized ideals. Great ideas after all stand up to close attention. Herman's book conveys a confidence in the values of the Western tradition, but in making its argument, it inspires a casual disrespect from the works of other arguably great thinkers and artists based on Herman's swift survey--a dubious achievement and troublesome side effect of this challenging book.</p>A learned study of the concept of decline since the Enlightenment, sure to generate widespread discussion and debate. A recent spate of books has proclaimed the ``end'' of just about everything from education to science to history itself. Historian Herman, coordinator of the Smithsonian's Western Civilization Program, has provided us with an invaluable historical context from which to re-examine this persistent belief that everything is in an inevitable process of decline. Herman has an admirable command of his sources. Part I, ``The Languages of Decline,'' reveals how a particular tradition of rhetoric combined with historical analysis and science (and sometimes pseudoscience) to produce a sense of doom. Part II, ``Predicting the Decline of the West,'' shows how popular the idea of decline was in the West in the 19th and early 20th centuries. But valuable as the book is in tracing the evolution of these ideas through an impressive array of sources, it's not without faults. Herman rather startlingly moves (without any seeming self-consciousness about the gesture) from a masterful analysis of the concept of decline in the recent past to what seems to be a personal and heartfelt attack on modern systems of thought. In Part III, ``The Triumph of Cultural Pessimism,'' readers who have read Allan Bloom's The Closing of the American Mind may feel a sense of d&#x201a;j... vu: Herman attacks the Frankfurt School and Critical Theory, as well as modern French philosophers from Sartre to Foucault. The book degenerates into a diatribe against multiculturalism and environmentalism, even making an implicit connection between the latter and Nazism. Hovering over the entire project, although never invoked, is the controversial 1989 essay ``The End of History,'' by Francis Fukuyama. A fascinating--and disturbing--study, and one that surely demands a response from those who firmly believe in the idea of progress. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But that doesn&#x2019;t mean that it&#x2019;s very much like Earth. </p><p>Barely half of Earth&#x2019;s size, Mars orbits roughly one and a half times farther from the Sun than Earth does. It is a small, cold, seemingly barren world, a frozen desert of ironrust sands from pole to pole.</p><p>Yet Mars is a spectacular world. The tallest mountain in the solar system is the aptly named Olympus Mons, a massive shield volcano three times higher than Everest, with a base as wide as the state of Idaho. The main caldera at Olympus Mons&#x2019;s summit could swallow Mt. Everest entirely. Other huge volcanoes dot the Tharsis highlands, all of them long extinct.</p><p>Almost halfway across the planet is Hellas Planitia, an enormous impact crater nearly the size of Australia and some five kilometers deep, gouged out when a huge meteor slammed into Mars eons ago.</p><p>Then there is Valles Marineris, the Grand Canyon of Mars, a gigantic rift in the ground that stretches farther than the distance between Boston and San Francisco, a fracture that is seven kilometers deep in some places and so wide that explorers standing on one rim of it cannot see the other side because it is beyond the horizon.</p><p>The atmosphere of Mars is a mere wisp, thinner than Earth&#x2019;s high stratosphere. It is composed mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen, oxygen, and inert gases such as argon and neon. The air pressure at the surface of Mars is about the same as the</p><p>pressure thirty- some kilometers up in the high stratosphere of Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, so thin that an uncovered glass of water will immediately boil away even when the temperature is far below zero.</p><p>Which it is most of the time. Mars is a cold world. At midsummer noon on the Martian equator, the ground temperature might get as high as seventy degrees Fahrenheit. But at the height of a person&#x2019;s nose the temperature would be zero, and that night it would plunge to a hundred below or even colder. The thin Martian atmosphere retains almost none of the Sun&#x2019;s heat: it reradiates back into space, even at noon on the equator.</p><p>There is water on Mars, however. The polar caps that can be seen from Earth even with an amateur telescope contain frozen water, usually overlain with frozen carbon dioxide: dry ice. Explorers found layers of permafrost&#x2014;frozen water&#x2014;beneath the surface, enough underground water to make an ocean or at least a sizable sea. </p><p>There is abundant evidence that water once flowed across the surface of Mars. The entire northern hemi sphere of the planet may once have been an ocean basin. Mars was once considerably warmer and wetter than it is now.</p><p>But today the surface of Mars is a barren desert of highly oxidized iron sands that give Mars its rusty red coloration.

The only solace she found was in her secret hobby: baking. With every sugary, buttery confection to emerge from her oven, Gesine took one step away from her glittery, empty existence&#x20ac;&#x201d;and one step closer to her true destiny. Before long, she and her husband left the trappings of their Hollywood lifestyle behind, ending up in Vermont, where they started the gem known as Gesine Confectionary. And they never looked back. Confections of a Closet Master Baker follows Gesine's journey from sugar-obsessed child to miserable, awkward Hollywood insider to reluctant master baker.

Gesine still lives in Vermont and is preparing to open another bakery in Austin, Texas.In this terrifically lively account chockfull of elegant, Old World recipes, Bullock-Prado, a former Hollywood film developer and sister to actress Sandra Bullock, recounts the joys and heartbreaks of running her own patisserie in Montpelier, Vt. Having fled the soul-sucking routine in Los Angeles with her husband, Ray, for the simpler pleasures of a small town near the Green Mountains, the author opened her own bake shop, Gesine Confectionary, in 2004, mostly on the fame of the macaroons she refashioned from her German mother's favorite almond treat, <i>mandelhoernchen</i> (and the casual mention in an interview her sister did for <i>In Style</i>). Although a law school graduate, Bullock-Prado always relished playing with sugar, butter, and flour and concocts an affectionate homage to her mother, who recently died from colon cancer, and grandmother. Her memoir follows one day in a busy baker's life, from waking at three a.m. to prepare the batter (croissants, scones, sticky buns) and bake before opening shop at seven; through the hectic lunch (focaccia); and the three p.m. tea time. In subtly compelling prose, the master baker conveys her touching sense of responsibility for the emotional needs of [her] patrons, and offers mouthwatering recipes. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While punk was first and foremost a music phenomenon, it reflected a DIY spirit and instantly recognizable aesthetic that was as raw and strident and irrepressible as the music.

What is "sacred" space? It is a place of dedication, where the miracles of life and growth are acknowledged as evidence of something larger than ourselves. That "something larger" can be called by many different names, and may refer to the presence of a specific deity, a unifying or supernatural pattern, or simply our membership in the great community of living organisms&#x2014;the discovered 1,413,000 separate species&#x2014;that populate the planet Earth. With understanding and acknowledgment, we can turn our own gardens into places of sanctuary. The Latin word for "sacred" gives us the word "sanctuary," denoting not only a sacred space but also a place of refuge and protection. The garden can become a place where we can restore our emotional and spiritual balance and nourish our sense and souls, away from the noise of everyday life. </p><p>Gardening is a vehicle for spiritual and emotional connection. It is, when you think about it, nothing short of miraculous: You kneel, dig a bit, drop in a seed, add waters, and wait. In time the miracle unveils itself, beginning with an ever-so-tentative shoot of green: Life! It is, perhaps, not as dramatic as being witness to the creation of the universe or event that moment when a single sperm pierces the shell of the human ovum, but for most of us it is as close as we will ever get to witnessing a miracle firsthand.</p></p><h2>The Pursuit of Tamsen Littlejohn: A Novel</h2><p><b>Frontier dangers cannot hold a candle to the risks one woman takes by falling in love</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>In an act of brave defiance, Tamsen Littlejohn escapes the life her harsh stepfather has forced upon her.

Jesse had the first two, one balanced across his thighs; the other tired, fly bitten, and dusty between them. As for staying power...with miles to go before he&#x2019;d be shed of those forty beeves, he was making a studied effort<br>to let patience have its perfect work in him.<br><br>Looking back across their brown and brindled ranks, he spotted Cade and the packhorses rounding a bend in the river trace, where sunlight still speared the hazy air in moted streaks of gold. Riding behind the drove at the mercy of its dust, Cade had a kerchief tied across his mouth and nose, hat pulled low to shield his eyes. Though Jesse hadn&#x2019;t ridden rear guard since midday, the choke of that same dust gritted his<br>throat. Grime coated the foot drovers too, spread out through the summerfattened herd, armed with rifles and staves, eyes darting glances at the crowding wooded slopes. <br><br>Grasshoppers whirred beside the trace, leaping clear of trampling hooves that crackled the weeds. The sun hung to westward, its warmth fading, leaving rivulets of sweat drying on Jesse&#x2019;s neck, sticking his shirt where the straps of bullet-bag and knapsack crossed. He was thinking they&#x2019;d reach their next camp a nip ahead of dark, with time to pen the cattle before swimming the dust off his hide, when something with the force of a slung stone clipped his hat brim. Thinking a deer fly had marked him for a meal, he reached for the hat, meaning to swat the pest. The hat was gone clean off his head. It dangled from a nearby tulip poplar, pinned by a feathered arrow.<br><br>Jesse gave a whoop, then was out of the saddle and ducking behind a clump of rhododendron, putting his horse crosswise between himself and the beeves. From across the river came a spotty rain of arrows, pinging off rocks, thunking into trees along the bank. The drovers ducked behind the cattle on the hill-slope side of the trace, rifles shouldered.<br><br>Jesse&#x2019;s mind raced. Was it Creeks or Chickamaugas? Either held an everlasting grudge against the Overmountain settlers. Hang it all, it could be Shawnees. With a wordless prayer that it wasn&#x2019;t, Jesse aimed his rifle at a tawny flash across the river and fired. Powder smoke plumed out white from the barrel. On the tail edge of the report, he heard Cade&#x2019;s war whoop. An answering ululation came shrill and defiant from across the water, raising the hairs on Jesse&#x2019;s arms.<br><br>The cattle milled and bunched, kicking up a dust blind. One took an arrow in the flank and went down in the middle of the trace, bawling in pain but thwarting the bulk of the herd&#x2019;s bolting.<br><br>Rifle shot cracked. Powder smoke hung on both sides of the river now, sharp and sulfurous. For the moment they had the water for a buffer. The attacking warriors wouldn&#x2019;t risk exposing themselves to cross unless sure of taking them down. Surprise was a weapon spent.<br><br>A brindled cow broke from the jostling herd. It plunged down the riverbank and crumpled in the shallows, shot through the neck. The front of the herd not blocked by the downed cow pressed up against the hillside and then shifted in Jesse&#x2019;s direction, threatening to stampede off down the trace. More broke for the river. Busy reloading, Jesse could do little but pray his horse stood its ground.<br><br>A musket ball ripped through rhody leaves near his head. Back down the trace Cade&#x2019;s rifle fired. A warrior across the river fell through brush, lay thrashing, and was dragged back into cover. Another such loss and the warriors would likely break and run. If they could hold them off a few more seconds...<br><br>New voices shattered a lull in the firing. Tremolo cries like the warble of crazed turkey cocks sounded up the slope behind them.<br><br>Fear jarred through Jesse. Faster than thought, he yanked free his belt ax and whirled to throw it&#x2014;and almost too late recognized the two Cherokee warriors. He shouted to the drovers to stop them firing on the blueshirted figures leaping down the rocky slope, dodging frightened cattle.<br><br>The Cherokees took cover on the bank, both with rifles, and commenced to putting them to use.<br><br>Jesse blazed a grin of welcome at the younger of the two now at his side, rammed patch and ball to powder, and fired across the river. A final arrow sailed over the cattle&#x2019;s backs. Then stillness fell, with smoke and dust drifting high on the river breeze.<br><br>The drovers moved among the beeves, soothing them with staves and words, settling their own nerves with rapid glances toward the river. The warriors had melted back into the forest, taking their wounded with them. It had been a hunting party, taking their chances on an unplanned raid. If it had been a tracking party out for scalps, there were far better spots to stage an ambush along their steep and winding route from&nbsp; Sycamore Shoals. A second attempt was unlikely. Jesse knew the thinking of such<br>men as well as he did his own.<br><br>After sliding his rifle into its saddle sling, he mounted and wheeled his horse after the few cows that had bolted up the trace. By the time Jesse had them headed back, Cade had sorted the herd and ridden up through their ranks, leading the packhorses. His gaze raked Jesse head to heel, relief deepening the creases beside his eyes. He took in the cow with the arrow in its flank, then the dead one reddening the river shallows, and yanked down his kerchief to show a mouth narrowed in regret. &#x201c;That dead one<br>looks like Tate&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2019;Fraid so,&#x201d; Jesse said. It was always a risk, pushing beeves down the mountains under the noses of Chickamauga warriors eager to cripple the Watauga settlers who depended on the sale of their stock. Jesse and Cade had hired on for this drove each September since the war with the British ended, tracing the Watauga River east to its mountain headwaters, then down to the Catawba River and the Carolina piedmont. The beeves were bound for the market cow pens, Jesse and Cade for Morganton to barter furs and hides for supplies and then hire on as guides for any settlers heading back Overmountain before snow fell.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d have lost more&#x2019;n cows had these wild turkeys not flushed from hiding.&#x201d; Jesse nodded at the late arrivals to the fray, both Overhill Cherokees. While the drovers cast half-wary looks at the two, Cade and Jesse slid off their horses to greet them.<br><br>&#x201c;Friends of yours, Cade?&#x201d; asked the white drover, owner of ten head of cattle and the two slaves helping drive them.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours too, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d; Cade looped his mare&#x2019;s reins around a sapling and grasped the arm of the elder Indian, a stocky man with gray threading the hair flowing from under his turban. &#x201c;Whatever brings you across our path, brothers, you&#x2019;ve our thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>Despite Cade&#x2019;s half-breed Delaware blood, little distinguished his looks from the men he greeted, save that his black hair was tailed back, not plucked to a scalp-lock, as was the younger Cherokee&#x2019;s. Cade&#x2019;s hat brim, pinned with a hawk&#x2019;s feather, shaded eyes one expected to be as dark as the battered felt but were instead as golden brown as Jesse&#x2019;s&#x2014;nothing to remark upon for a man of Jesse&#x2019;s coloring. In Cade&#x2019;s tawny face, they often drew a second look.<br><br>&#x201c;Thunder-Going-Away,&#x201d; Cade said, naming the elder Cherokee first, by way of introduction. &#x201c;And Catches Bears, his son.&#x201d;<br><br>The drover gave a wary nod. &#x201c;Elijah Rhodes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jabez and Billy,&#x201d; Jesse added, with a nod at Rhodes&#x2019;s slaves. Billy, fourteen and on his first drive, was shaking in the wake of the attack&#x2014;with excitement as much from shock, Jesse thought. &#x201c;Think one them Injuns was Dragging Canoe? Them bad Injuns, I mean,&#x201d; Billy added with a sidelong look at the Cherokees.<br><br>&#x201c;Doubt it.&#x201d; Jesse grinned at the boy, who&#x2019;d prattled on about the infamous Chickamauga war chief since starting from Sycamore Shoals.<br><br>&#x201c;Dragging Canoe would&#x2019;ve crossed right over that river and lifted our scalps. Ain&#x2019;t you heard? He can swim like a fish and fly like a raven.&#x201d; The boy&#x2019;s eyes whitened around the rims.<br><br>Jabez, an old hand at droving, slapped Billy&#x2019;s back, raising dust. &#x201c;He pulling yo&#x2019; leg, boy. Canoe ain&#x2019;t no demon-bird. Just a man like me and you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Huh,&#x201d; Billy said, looking unconvinced.<br><br>Cade was eying Thunder-Going, a question in his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a long way from Chota.&#x201d;<br><br>Thunder-Going raised his chin, nodding back toward the northwest. &#x201c;Tate Allard said we missed you by three sleeps. We trailed you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not hard to do,&#x201d; Bears said, nostrils flaring wide, &#x201c;with the stink these cows leave.&#x201d;<br><br>Thunder-Going hid a smile in the lines carved beside his mouth. &#x201c;We meant to catch you coming back from Morganton, to invite you to a feast. My daughter is to join blankets with a husband.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;White Shell? &#x2019;Bout time.&#x201d; Three pairs of eyes turned to Jesse when he spoke. The Cherokees and even Cade were looking at him as if he ought to say more on the matter. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>Bears snorted. &#x201c;You see? He does not know.&#x201d;<br><br>Jesse frowned. &#x201c;What don&#x2019;t I know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My sister wanted you,&#x201d; Bears said. &#x201c;But you had no eyes to see her, so she chose one who does.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My daughter was not the one for you,&#x201d; Thunder-Going said and shrugged away what looked to Jesse like mild disappointment. Then the Cherokee inquired of Cade, though he still eyed Jesse, &#x201c;Is it to be Allard&#x2019;s girl, who follows this one like a puppy?&#x201d;<br><br>Jesse cut in before Cade could answer that. &#x201c;I have not found the one. I will know when I have, and maybe then I will tell you about it.&#x201d; They&#x2019;d fallen into Tsalagi, the Cherokee tongue. Switching to English, he said, &#x201c;Oughtn&#x2019;t we to be pushing on?&#x201d;<br><br>Rhodes was in agreement. &#x201c;How far to the next camp?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mile or two,&#x201d; Cade said. &#x201c;Have to tend the downed cows first.&#x201d;<br><br>Bears and his father exchanged a look. Thunder-Going said, &#x201c;You go on with the herd. We will skin out the dead one. Better the hide than nothing, eh? For a share of the meat, we will bring that along as well. As much as we can carry.&#x201d;<br><br>The plan agreed to, Jesse mounted up. Behind him Cade said, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your hat got to, Jesse?&#x201d;<br><br>It still hung from the poplar, neat as on a cabin wall. Cade reached it first. He wrenched out the arrow, his face gone a shade like greened copper. In his eyes a heap of words clamored to be said, but he handed Jesse the hat and went to deal with the wounded cow on the trace. Fingering the hole in the hat&#x2019;s brim, Jesse watched Cade snap the arrow nearer the wound, leaving enough to grasp. Cade urged the cow to its feet.

Lots of sidebars cover all sorts of material Reidelbach (Miniature Golf, 1987--not reviewed) couldn't integrate into her main narrative, especially profiles of Mad's legendary publisher, William Gaines, and biographies of the many talented writers and illustrators he's employed over the years. Anarchic, irreverent, cynical, and absurdist, Mad began its nearly 40-year history as a four-color comic book edited by Harvey Kurtzman, who brought a new level of satiric sophistication to a medium reserved mostly for superhero dreck and cute funny animals. In fact, the early Mad parodied the funny pages with the same cleverness it would later bring to bear on advertising, movies, and TV. When the comic-book industry imposed new restrictions on itself in the mid-50's, Gaines transformed Mad into a magazine rather than submit it to the censors. While Kurtzman left for other projects, Gaines and his new editor, Al Feldstein, made Mad more accessible to a wider audience. Circulation grew from 325,000 to a high of 2.5 million, with a worldwide readership (in numerous translations and adaptations). Published domestically every 45 days, and with no advertising, Mad provoked the ire of social watchdogs everywhere- -nothing seemed sacred to the self-described ``usual gang of idiots'' who mocked the many icons of modern life. Serious cultural critics like Marshall McLuhan, Paul Goodman, and Dwight Macdonald all found the popular humor mag worthy of analysis as a genuine reflection of tumultuous times. Reidelbach strains when she describes Mad's worry-less mascot, Alfred E. Neuman, as ``an archetype of the Jungian sort,'' and her imitations of the Mad style are as annoying as the book's cluttered design. Nevertheless, it's a fine overview of a vital part of pop culture, and a must-read for true Mad ``fan-addicts.''

All rights reserved.</i>Publisher Bill Gaines and editor Harvey Kurtzman produced the first issue of Mad magazine in 1956 and American satirical humor has never been the same since. Beginning with the comic book company founded by his father, Max, Gaines transformed his father's wholesome comics lines into EC Comics, the profitable publisher of classic 1950s' horror comics, and later introduced Mad and its mascot, the "What Me Worry" kid, Alfred E. Neuman. Although basically celebratory and uncritical, art historian Reidelbach's detailed history of Mad mentions recent criticisms of sexist and homophobic material in the magazine as well as Mad 's (and the comics industry's) contested policies on the ownership of commissioned artwork. Most amusing are descriptions of Gaines--who continues to run the profitable magazine as a "benevolent dictatorship"--and his idiosyncratic management theories ( Mad accepts no advertising, has never conducted a reader survey and does little merchandising). The book is chock-full of Mad material--the usual "trash," as Mad always describes its own contents--as well as information on the many freelance artists and writers who have worked for the magazine. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Masters of Art: Fra Angelico (Masters of Italian Art)</h2><p>The artist and Dominican friar posthumously called Fra Angelico pioneered many of the stylistic trends that distinguish the early Renaissance, including the rational treatment of pictorial space and the volumetric modeling of forms with light and shadow.

This was his favorite view of the Chisholm Cattle Company. He'd always felt a sense of pride and respect for the ranching empire his father had built.<p>Today, though, he felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders for the ranch and feared for his father&#x2014;and the future. Someone wanted to destroy not only what Hoyt Chisholm had built, but Hoyt himself.</p><p>"I'm going to ride up into the high country and check the cattle on summer range," he'd told his five brothers. They knew him well enough to realize that as the oldest brother he needed some time alone after everything that had happened.</p><p>They'd been at the main house sitting around the kitchen table this morning, avoiding the dining room since their father had been arrested for murder and their stepmother, Emma, had taken off to parts unknown.</p><p>The house had felt too empty, so they had all moved back in even though they had their own houses on the huge ranch. When their father's new bride, Emma, had come to the house two months ago, she'd required them all to show up freshly showered and changed for supper every evening.</p><p>No one questioned Emma's new rules, which included no swearing in the house and bowing their heads in prayer before supper. In the weeks since she and Hoyt had wed, she'd made a lot of changes at Chisholm Cattle Company.</p><p>That was until the body of Hoyt's third wife turned up and he'd been arrested.</p><p>Dawson still couldn't believe it. There was no way his father was a murderer. Unfortunately, given the evidence against him and his wealth, the judge had denied bail and Hoyt was now sitting in jail in Whitehorse awaiting trial.</p><p>Emma... Well, she'd packed up and skipped town with only a short note saying she couldn't do this. It had broken their father's heart. Hoyt Chisholm had looked older than his fifty-six years when Dawson had visited him yesterday evening. He'd taken the news about Emma even worse than Dawson had thought he would.</p><p>"Emma wouldn't just leave," his father had argued. Emma had been nothing like his father's other wives. Redheaded with a fiery temper, plump and annoyingly cheerful. Her stepsons hadn't wanted to like her. But she'd won them all over and their father clearly adored her.</p><p>"She left a note, said she couldn't do this and packed up all her stuff and was gone when we got home," Dawson said, unable to hide his own anger&#x2014; and not just at Emma. His father had gone off to a cattleman's meeting in Denver two months ago and, after a quick stop in Vegas, had come back with a wife. Why was his father surprised the woman would leave, under the circumstances?</p><p>"Listen to me," Hoyt said, leaning forward behind the thick piece of bulletproof glass as he spoke into the phone provided for inmates to talk to visitors. "Emma wouldn't leave. You have to find her."</p><p>Dawson didn't need this. He and his brothers were having a hard enough time running the ranch without their father. He had a lot more important things to do than find his father's fourth wife.</p><p>But, he had to admit grudgingly, he'd liked Emma and maybe that was why he was so angry with her for bailing on their father.</p><p>"Where would you suggest I look? Is there family I can call? Friends? Is she even from Denver?" When his father didn't answer any of the questions, he said, "You really don't know anything about her, do you?"</p><p>"I know she wouldn't leave me," Hoyt had snapped.</p><p>Dawson sighed now, took one last look at the ranch and spurred his horse into the thick cool darkness of the pines. The ride up from the main house had taken most of the day. The big blue sky overhead was tinted pink to the west where the sun had dipped behind the Bear Paw Mountains.</p><p>He breathed in the sweet scent of pine. Since he was a boy, he'd always come to the high country when life got to be too much down on the prairie. Having five brothers, all of them adopted by Hoyt years ago, not even a ranch as large as this one felt big enough sometimes.</p><p>"I need one of you to see if you can find Emma," he'd told his brothers before he'd ridden out.</p><p>"Dad just doesn't want to believe that she deserted him," Marshall had said. "What's the point in finding her? She won't come back."</p><p>"I'll go," Zane had said, speaking up. When they all looked at him as if he was crazy, he said, "Dad loves her. He has enough problems without worrying about Emma. I'll see if I can find her. Did he give you any place to start?"</p><p>"All we know is that he met her in Denver," Dawson had said. "I suppose you could start there."</p><p>None of them had any hope that Zane would find her. Even less hope that if he did, she would come back and stand by their father's side during his trial.</p><p>Dawson couldn't really blame Emma when he thought about it. Rumors had circled around Chisholm Cattle Company for years after Hoyt's first wife, Laura, had drowned on a Fork Peck Reservoir boating trip.</p><p>The rumors only got worse after his second wife, Tasha, had been killed on a runaway horse. When his third wife, Krystal, had disappeared, never to be seen again, people who knew him were convinced Hoyt Chisholm had the worst luck with wives. Others weren't so sure.</p><p>There was at least one person&#x2014;an insurance investigator&#x2014;who suspected that Hoyt Chisholm had not only murdered all three wives, but would also do the same with his latest, Emma.</p><p>Dawson knew better. Hoyt was his father, the man who had adopted three motherless boys&#x2014;Colton, Logan and Zane when the triplets' mother had died in childbirth, father unknown. He'd adopted Dawson, Tanner and Marshall when their mother had abandoned them, father also unknown.</p><p>Hoyt probably would have adopted even more children who needed homes if it hadn't been for the trouble with his wives.</p><p>Dawson, the oldest, was three when his father married his second wife, Tasha. They had been married only a short time before her death. He was five when Krystal came into their lives. She'd stayed an even shorter time. He doubted his brothers, who were all a few years younger, remembered any of them.</p><p>After that their father had raised them alone. All six of them now ranged from twenty-six to thirty-three. And then Hoyt Chisholm had met Emma.</p><p>A new wife had spurred all that old talk about Hoyt's other wives and brought former insurance investigator Aggie Wells back into their lives&#x2014;until she'd gone missing. That was when their father's third wife's body had turned up. Aggie was still missing.</p><p>Dawson felt the temperature begin to drop up here in the mountains. He loved this ride from the sagebrush and prairie to the rocky mountain range, the towering pines and rush of snow-fed creeks. He'd been raised on a horse and felt as at home there as he did in the high country.</p><p>At heart he was a cattleman, he thought as he heard the comforting sound of cows lowing just over the ridge. There was nothing like that sound or seeing the herd scattered across a wide meadow.</p><p>He stopped a short way into the meadow and leaned on his saddle horn to admire the black cattle against the summer-green meadow. Chisholm Cattle Company raised the finest Black Angus beef there was&#x2014;and lots of them.</p><p>At that moment he realized what a loner he was. Before Emma had left, he'd noticed that she'd seemed intent on seeing each of her stepsons settle down with the perfect woman. He shook his head at the thought. Was there a woman alive who could understand his need to ride up here and camp out for a few days with only cows as company?</p><p>He laughed at the thought, remembering some of the women he'd dated. Even hard-core country girls weren't all that up for roughin' it. He thought of the one woman he'd known who might have and quickly pushed the painful thought away.</p><p>A cold breeze stirred the deep shadows that had settled into the pine boughs. He glanced across the meadow to the spot where he usually camped and saw something move in the trees.</p><p>A hawk burst from a high branch. The cattle began to moo loudly and move restlessly in the bowl-like meadow. Something was spooking them. A mountain lion? A grizzly?</p><p>Dawson stared into the trees across the meadow and started to pull his rifle from the scabbard on his saddle, thinking it had to be a large predator for the cattle to get this nervous.</p><p>The first rider came out of the trees at a gallop. Dawson pulled his rifle as the rustler came into view and fired a shot into the air as warning before taking aim to fire another. The cattle began to scatter.</p><p>A second rustler appeared, then another and another broke from the pines; shots rang out across the grazing land as the rustlers tried to circle the now stampeding cattle.</p><p>Dawson realized the cattle were headed right for him&#x2014;and so was one of the riders.</p><p><i>Chapter Two</i></p><p>With the stampeding cattle headed directly at him, Dawson realized there was nowhere to go to get away from them, and it was too late to try to outrun the herd. He was about to be caught in the middle of the stampede.</p><p>He reined his horse around in time to see one of the rustlers turn the herd at the last moment&#x2014;and just enough that he was able to get out of the way. The cattle thundered past in a cloud of dust&#x2014;the rustler with them.</p><p>Dawson sheathed his rifle, spurred his horse and took off after him. The rider was moving fast, bent over the horse and riding as if his life depended on it. It did, because Dawson was gaining on him. Just a few more yards...</p><p>Riding up behind him, Dawson dived off his horse, tackling the rustler. Both of them hit the ground at the edge of the thundering herd of cattle and rolled into the tall grass. Dust boiled up around them as they came to a stop at the base of a large pine tree, Dawson coming out on top.</p><p>As the dust settled, he got his first good look at the rustler.

The tale is about a young boy who is taken by a <em>div</em> (a sort of ogre), and how that fate might not be as terrible as it first seems&#x2014;a brilliant device that firmly sets the tone for the rest of this sweeping, heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting novel. A day after he tells the tale of the <em>div</em>, the father gives away his own daughter to a wealthy man in Kabul. What follows is a series of stories within the story, told through multiple viewpoints, spanning more than half a century, and shifting across continents. The novel moves through war, separation, birth, death, deceit, and love, illustrating again and again how people&#x2019;s actions, even the seemingly selfless ones, are shrouded in ambiguity.

Was Israel&#x2019;s first king, Saul, a hero or a disaster? Was David a gifted and accomplished leader or a murderer and a cheat? Did Solomon preside over the most glorious epoch in Israelite history or did he lead the nation into a fateful decline? <br>In <i>I Chronicles</i>, the distinguished scholar Gary Knoppers addresses these questions through a thoughtful and exacting reading of one of the last books of the Hebrew Bible. He shows that Chronicles, which contains a variety of viewpoints on the major events and people, provides a distinct perspective on much of Israel&#x2019;s past, especially the monarchy. He discusses how the chronicler&#x2019;s introduction to the people of Israel redefines Israel itself; explains and defends the transition from Saul to David; and shows how the Davidic-Solomonic monarchy was not only a time of incomparable achievement and glory, but also the period during which the nations most important public institutions &#x2013;the Davidic dynasty, the Jerusalem Temple, the priests, and the Levites&#x2014;took formative shape. <br><i>I Chronicles</i>, part of a two-volume set, is the first to employ systematically the Dead Sea Scrolls to reconstruct the biblical author&#x2019;s text. Knoppers reveals how Chronicles is related to and creatively drawn from many earlier biblical books, and presents a fascinating look at its connections, in both compositional style and approach, to the historical writings of ancient Mesopotamia and classical Greece. Featuring a new translation and an extensive introduction that incorporates up-to-date research, this volume replaces the Anchor Bible <i>I Chronicles</i> commentary written by Jacob Myers in 1965.</p></p><p><p>Gary Knoppers is Head of the Department of Classics and Ancient Mediterranean Studies at Penn State University. In addition to writing and editing three books, he has published articles in such scholarly publications as <i>Biblica</i>, <i>Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research</i>, <i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly</i>, and <i>Journal of Near Eastern Studies</i>.</p></p><h2>Sold into Egypt (Wheaton Literary Series)</h2><p><p>This classic work of spirituality from the author of <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> offers life-transforming insights on the rich heritage of the Bible and shows how the characters of this ancient text are relevant for living the good life now.</p><p>Is Joseph&#x2014;the deserted son of Jacob from the Old Testament&#x2014;relevant in our modern age? For Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle, the answer is a resounding yes; not solely because Joseph is an important historical character, but primarily because his experiences of disenfranchisement, tragedy, and profound betrayal resonate within our own society. These thoughtful meditations on obedience, prophecy, forgiveness, and compassion are masterfully woven to bridge gaps of belief, politics, education, and even faith. In this, L&#x2019;Engle&#x2019;s third book of her Genesis Trilogy, the author draws on the death of her husband to provide comfort and inspiration to those who suffer grief, loneliness, and doubt.</p><p>Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle possesses the same ambidextrous skill of storytelling as other literary giants, including C. S. Lewis and George MacDonald. Her fictional stories appeal to generations of readers, and are equally embraced in both the secular and religious markets. But it is her ability in her nonfiction work to engage with the historical text of the book of Genesis through a dynamic unpacking of protagonists, antagonists, and matters of faith that establishes the Genesis Trilogy as a highly treasured collection of spiritual writings. The wisdom, gentleness, and insight of <i>Sold into Egypt</i> offers readers practical advice on clinging to hope, even in the midst of loss and disappointment.</p></p><p><b>Madeleine L'Engle</b> was the author of more than forty-five books for all ages, among them the beloved <i>A Wrinkle in Time,</i> awarded the Newbery Medal; <i>A Ring of Endless Light,</i> a Newbery Honor Book; <i>A Swiftly Tilting Planet,</i> winner of the American Book Award; and the Austin family series of which <i>Troubling a Star</i> is the fifth book.

In North Carolina, he lived for several years with the Cherokee, studying their language, culture, and mythology. His research resulted in this comprehensive volume, comprising 126 Cherokee myths, including sacred stories, animal myths, local legends, wonder stories, historical traditions, and miscellaneous myths and legends.<br>Among the myths included are these:<br>How the World Was Made; Origin of Strawberries; Why the Deer's Teeth Are Blunt; How the Turkey Got His Beard; The Rattlesnake's Vengeance; The Ice Man; The First Fire; Why the Possum's Tail Is Bare; The Bride from the South; The Water Cannibals; The Haunted Whirlpool; The War Medicine,&nbsp;and many more.<br>In addition to his clear retelling of the myths themselves, the author provides extensive background information on Cherokee history, notes on the myths, parallels between Cherokee and other myths, and further important information.

I didn't want to rant. I'd mounted my Sony camcorder on a tripod and rotated the LCD screen in order to see myself as I spoke. I'd lost weight over the past weeks. My eyes were red with fatigue, the orbits shiny and dark. I looked more like a hunted criminal than a grieving friend. </p><p> "I don't really know where to begin. I keep seeing Andrew lying on the floor. And I know they killed him. But...I'm getting ahead of myself. You need facts. I was born in 1961 in Los Alamos, New Mexico. My father was James Howard Tennant, the nuclear physicist. My mother was Ann Tennant, a pediatrician. I'm making this tape in a sober state of mind, and I'm going to deposit it with my attorney as soon as I finish, on the understanding that it should be opened if I die for any reason. </p><p> "Six hours ago, my colleague Dr. Andrew Fielding was found dead beside his desk, the victim of an apparent stroke. I can't prove it, but I know Fielding was murdered. For the past two years, he and I have been part of a scientific team funded by the National Security Agency and DARPA -- the government agency that created the Internet in the 1970s. Under the highest security classification, that team and its work are known as Project Trinity." </p><p> I glanced down at the short-barreled Smith &amp; Wesson .38 in my lap. I'd made sure the pistol wasn't visible on camera, but it calmed me to have it within reach. Reassured, I again stared at the glowing red light. </p><p> "Two years ago, Peter Godin, founder of the Godin Supercomputing Corporation, had an epiphany much like that mythical moment when an apple dropped onto Isaac Newton's head. It happened in a dream. Seemingly from nowhere, a seventy-year-old man visualized the most revolutionary possibility in the history of science. When he woke up, Godin telephoned John Skow, a deputy director of the NSA, in Fort Meade, Maryland. By six A.M., the two men had drafted and delivered a letter to the president of the United States. That letter shook the White House to its foundations. I know this because the president was my brother's close friend in college. My brother died three years ago, but because of him, the president knew of my work, which is what put me in the middle of all that followed." </p><p> I rubbed the cool metal of the .38, wondering what to tell and what to leave out. <i>Leave out nothing,</i> said a voice in my head. My father's voice. Fifty years ago, he'd played his own part in America's secret history, and that burden had greatly shortened his days. My father died in 1988, a haunted man, certain that the Cold War he'd spent his youthful energy to perpetuate would end with the destruction of civilization, as it so easily could have. <i>Leave out nothing....</i> </p><p> "The Godin Memo," I continued, "had the same effect as the letter Albert Einstein sent President Roosevelt at the beginning of World War Two, outlining the potential for an atomic bomb and the possibility that Nazi Germany might develop one. Einstein's letter spurred the Manhattan Project, the secret quest to ensure that America would be the first to possess nuclear weapons. Peter Godin's letter resulted in a project of similar scope but infinitely greater ambition. Project Trinity began behind the walls of an NSA front corporation in the Research Triangle Park of North Carolina. Only six people on the planet ever had full knowledge of Trinity. Now that Andrew Fielding is dead, only five remain. I'm one. The other four are Peter Godin, John Skow, Ravi Nara -- " </p><p> I bolted to my feet with the .38 in my hand. Someone was rapping on my front door. Through thin curtains, I saw a Federal Express truck parked at the foot of my sidewalk. What I couldn't see was the space immediately in front of my door. </p><p> "Who is it?" I called. </p><p> "FedEx," barked a muffled male voice. "I need a signature." </p><p> I wasn't expecting a delivery. "Is it a letter or a package?" </p><p> "Letter." </p><p> "Who from?" </p><p> "Uhh...Lewis Carroll." </p><p> I shivered. A package from a dead man? Only one person would send me a package under the name of the author of Alice in Wonderland. Andrew Fielding. Had he sent me something the day before he died? Fielding had been obsessively searching the Trinity labs for weeks now, the computers as well as the physical space. Perhaps he'd found something. And perhaps whatever it was had got him killed. I'd sensed something strange about Fielding's behavior yesterday -- not so easy with a man famed for his eccentricities -- but by this morning he'd seemed to be his old self. </p><p> "Do you want this thing or not?" asked the deliveryman. </p><p> I cocked the pistol and edged over to the door. I'd fastened the chain latch when I'd got home. With my left hand, I unlocked the door and pulled it open to the length of the chain. Through the crack, I saw the face of a uniformed man in his twenties, his hair bound into a short ponytail. </p><p> "Pass your pad through with the package. I'll sign and give it back to you." </p><p> "It's a digital pad. I can't give you that." </p><p> "Keep your hand on it, then." </p><p> "Paranoid," he muttered, but he stuck a thick orange pad through the crack in the door. </p><p> I grabbed the stylus hanging from the string and scrawled my name on the touch-sensitive screen. "Okay." </p><p> The pad disappeared, and a FedEx envelope was thrust through. I took it and tossed it onto the sofa, then shut the door and waited until I heard the truck rumble away from the curb. </p><p> I picked up the envelope and glanced at the label. "Lewis Carroll" had been signed in Fielding's spidery hand. As I pulled the sheet of paper from the envelope, a greasy white granular substance spilled over my fingers. The instant my eyes registered the color, some part of my brain whispered <i>anthrax</i>. The odds of that were low, but my best friend had just died under suspicious circumstances. A certain amount of paranoia was justified. </p><p> I hurried to the kitchen and scrubbed my hands with dish soap and water. Then I pulled a black medical bag from my closet. Inside was the usual pharmacopoeia of the M.D.'s home: analgesics, anti-biotics, emetics, steroid cream. I found what I wanted in a snap compartment: a blister pack of Cipro, a powerful broad-spectrum antibiotic. I swallowed one pill with water from the tap, then took a pair of surgical gloves from the bag. As a last precaution, I tied a dirty T-shirt from the hamper around my nose and mouth. Then I folded the FedEx envelope and letter into separate Ziploc bags, sealed them, and laid them on the counter. </p><p> As badly as I wanted to read the letter, part of me resisted. Fielding might have been murdered for what was written on that page. Even if that weren't the case, nothing good would come from my reading it. </p><p> I carefully vacuumed the white granules from the carpet in the front room, wondering if I could be wrong about Fielding's death being murder. He and I had worked ourselves into quite a state of suspicion over the past weeks, but then we had reason to. And the timing was too damn convenient. Instead of putting the vacuum cleaner back into the closet, I walked to the back door and tossed the machine far into the yard. I could always buy another one. </p><p> I was still eerily aware of the letter sitting on the kitchen counter. I felt like a soldier's wife refusing to open a telegram. But I already knew my friend was dead. So what did I fear? </p><p> <i>The why,</i> answered a voice in my head. Fielding talking. <i>You want to keep your head in the sand. It's the American national pastime....</i> </p><p> More than a little irritated to find that the dead could be as bothersome as the living, I picked up the Ziploc containing the letter and carried it to the front room. The note was brief and handwritten. </p><p><br> <i>David, </i></p><p><i> We must meet again. I finally confronted Godin with my suspicions. His reaction astounded me. I don't want to commit anything to paper, but I know I'm right. Lu Li and I are driving to the blue place on Saturday night. Please join us. It's close quarters, but discreet. It may be time for you to contact your late brother's friend again, though I wonder if even he can do anything at this point. Things like this have a momentum greater than individuals. Greater even than humanity, I fear. If anything should happen to me, don't forget that little gold item I asked you to hold for me one day. Desperate times, mate. I'll see you Saturday.</i> </p><p><br> There was no signature, but below the note was a hand-drawn cartoon of a rabbit's head and the face of a clock. The White Rabbit, an affectionate nickname given Fielding by his Cambridge physics students. Fielding always carried a gold pocket watch, and that was the "little gold item" that he had asked me to hold for him one day. </p><p> We were passing each other in the hallway when he pressed the watch and chain into my hand. "Mind keeping that for an hour, old man?" he'd murmured. "Lovely." Then he was gone. An hour later he stopped by my office to pick it up, saying he hadn't wanted to take the watch into the MRI lab with him, where it could have been smashed against the MRI unit by the machine's enormous magnetic fields. But Fielding visited the MRI lab all the time, and he'd never given me his pocket watch before. And he never did again. It must have been in his pocket when he died. So what the hell was he up to that day? </p><p> I read the note again. <i>Lu Li and I are driving to the blue place on Saturday night.</i> Lu Li was Fielding's new Chinese wife. The "blue place" had to be code for a beach cabin at Nags Head, on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Three months ago, when Fielding asked for a recommendation for his honeymoon, I'd suggested the Nags Head cabin, which was only a few hours away. Fielding and his wife had loved the place, and the Englishman had apparently thought of it when he wanted a secure location to discuss his fears. </p><p> My hands were shaking. The man who had written this note was now as cold as the morgue table he was lying on, if indeed he was lying in a morgue. No one had been able -- or willing -- to tell me where my friend's body would be taken. And now the white powder. Would Fielding have put powder in the envelope and neglected to mention it in his letter? If he didn't, who did? Who but the person who had murdered him? </p><p> I laid the letter on the sofa, stripped off the surgical gloves, and rewound the videotape to the point at which I'd walked out of the frame. I had decided to make this tape because I feared I might be killed before I could tell the president what I knew. Fielding's letter had changed nothing. Yet as I stared into the lens, my mind wandered. I was way ahead of Fielding on calling my "late brother's friend." The moment I'd seen Fielding's corpse on the floor of his office, I knew I had to call the president. But the president was in China. Still, as soon as I got clear of the Trinity lab, I'd called the White House from a pay phone in a Shoney's restaurant, a "safe" phone Fielding had told me about. It couldn't be seen by surveillance teams in cars, and the restaurant's interior geometry made it difficult for a parabolic microphone to eavesdrop from a distance. </p><p> When I said "Project Trinity," the White House operator put me through to a man who gruffly asked me to state my business. I asked to speak to Ewan McCaskell, the president's chief of staff, whom I'd met during my visit to the Oval Office. McCaskell was in China with the president. I asked that the president be informed that David Tennant needed to speak to him urgently about Project Trinity, and that no one else involved with Trinity should be informed. The man said my message would be passed on and hung up. </p><p> Thirteen hours separated North Carolina and Beijing. That made it tomorrow in China. Daylight. Yet four hours had passed since my call, and I'd heard nothing. Would my message be relayed to China, given the critical nature of the summit? There was no way to know. I did know that if someone at Trinity heard about my call first, I might wind up as dead as Fielding before I talked to the president. </p><p> I hit start on the remote control and spoke again to the camera. </p><p> "In the past six months I've gone from feeling like part of a noble scientific effort to questioning whether I'm even living in the United States. I've watched Nobel laureates give up all principle in a search for -- " </p><p> I went still. Something had passed by one of my front windows. A face. Very close, peering inside. I'd seen it through the sheer curtains, but I was sure. A face, framed by shoulder-length hair. I had a sense of a woman's features, but... </p><p> I started to get up, then sat back down. My teeth were vibrating with an electric pain like aluminum foil crushed between dental fillings. My eyelids felt too heavy to hold open. <i>Not now,</i> I thought, shoving my hand into my pocket for my prescription bottle. <i>Jesus, not now.</i> For six months, every member of Trinity's inner circle had suffered frightening neurological symptoms. No one's symptoms were the same. My affliction was narcolepsy. Narcolepsy and dreams. At home, I usually gave in to the trancelike sleep. But when I needed to fight off a spell -- at Trinity, or driving my car -- only amphetamines could stop the overwhelming waves. </p><p> I pulled out my prescription bottle and shook it. <i>Empty.</i> I'd swallowed my last pill yesterday. I got my speed from Ravi Nara, Trinity's neurologist, but Nara and I were no longer speaking. I tried to rise, thinking I'd call a pharmacy and prescribe my own, but that was ridiculous. I couldn't even stand. A leaden heaviness had settled into my limbs. My face felt hot, and my eyelids began to fall. </p><p> The prowler was at the window again. In my mind, I raised my gun and aimed it, but then I saw the weapon lying in my lap. Not even survival instinct could clear the fog filling my brain. I looked back at the window. The face was gone. <i>A woman's face.</i> I was sure of it. Would they use a woman to kill me? Of course. They were pragmatists. They used what worked. </p><p> Something scratched at my doorknob. Through the thickening haze I fought to aim my gun at the door. Something slammed against the wood. I got my finger on the trigger, but as my swimming brain transmitted the instruction to depress it, sleep annihilated consciousness like fingers snuffing a candle flame. </p><p><br> <i>Andrew Fielding sat alone at his desk, furiously smoking a cigarette. His hands were shaking from a confrontation with Godin. It had happened the previous day, but Fielding had the habit of replaying such scenes in his mind, agonizing over how ineffectually he had stated his case, murmuring retorts he should have made at the time but had not. </i></p><p><i> The argument had been the result of weeks of frustration.

Later, as government leaders became concerned about public complacency brought on by Allied victories, they released some of these photographs of war's brutality. But to the war's end and after, they continued to censor photographs of mutilated or emotionally distressed American soldiers, of racial conflicts at American bases, and other visual evidence of disunity or disorder. In this book George H. Roeder, Jr., tells the intriguing story of how American opinions about World War II were manipulated both by the wartime images that citizens were allowed to see and by the images that were suppressed. His text is amplified by arresting visual essays that include many previously unpublished photographs from the army's censored files.<br><br>Examining news photographs, movies, newsreels, posters, and advertisements, Roeder explores the different ways that civilian and military leaders used visual imagery to control the nation's perception of the war and to understate the war's complexities. He reveals how image makers tried to give minorities a sense of equal participation in the war while not alarming others who clung to the traditions of separate races, classes, and gender roles. He argues that the most pervasive feature of wartime visual imagery was its polarized depiction of the world as good or bad, and he discusses individuals&#x2015;Margaret Bourke-White, Bill Mauldin, Elmer Davis, and others&#x2015;who fought against these limitations. He shows that the polarized ways of viewing encouraged by World War II influenced American responses to political issues for decades to follow, particularly in the simplistic way that the Vietnam War was depicted by both official and antiwar forces.</p><p><b>George H. Roeder, Jr.,</b> is professor of liberal arts at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. <br>The U.S. government during World War II was quick to realize the power of visual images and sought ways to control their uses. Roeder (Sch. of the Art Institute of Chicago) explores most aspects of the government's policies on visual images and the consequences of those actions, especially concerning the Vietnam War. One of the strongest aspects of wartime visual imagery, Roeder states, is its "polarized depiction of the world." Four "visual essays" illustrate points made in the text: for example, in the essay entitled "Playing the Death Card," the author discusses how the government censored photographs of the dead, but how this policy changed as World War II dragged on. Images range from hospitalized soldiers in a cheerful group to relatively "mild" pictures of dead Americans on the beach of Buna, in the Pacific.

There was no welcoming smile, just a cool gaze as Gary Morgan stood nervously in the doorway. <br>&#x201c;So you are one of my new interns for the summer?&#x201d; Erich asked. &#x201c;I already told them there is no need for interns here&#x2014;at least, those who want a solid future. May I suggest you just go back to the personnel office and ask for a different assignment.&#x201d; <br>Gary didn&#x2019;t move. He had been warned by &#x201c;veterans&#x201d; who had served as interns with Dr. Rothenberg that this was his typical greeting, the first winnowing-out process in which more than one graduate student had taken him at his word and fled. <br>He stood his ground. <br>&#x201c;I volunteered for this division, sir. It is why I came to Goddard for the summer and asked to be assigned to you.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh? Pray tell why.&#x201d; Still there was no welcoming gesture to take a seat. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve read most of your papers, sir, at least the unclassified ones: your prediction that Apollo would turn into a political dead end after the first landing, objections to the space station rather than an effort on advance propulsion systems and setting Mars as the next goal&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I sail against the wind,&#x201d; Erich said gruffly. &#x201c;Not a good path for career advancement.&#x201d; <br>Gary didn&#x2019;t move. <br>&#x201c;Oh, damn it, come on in and sit down,&#x201d; Erich sighed. Gary was smart enough not to show any emotion; he had at least passed the first test. He was, at least, literally through the door and into the office. Very few ever made it that far. <br>Leaning back in his chair, Erich pulled out a battered Zippo lighter adorned with the faded insignia of his old commando unit and puffed his pipe back to life. It was now a violation of the new no-smoking rule for the facility, but like all such rules, Erich had a few choice words in reply, either in High German or Yiddish, depending on who he was addressing&#x2014;though he did compromise by keeping the door closed and a noisy air purifier running. <br>&#x201c;Let us skip the sentimental formalities of greetings,&#x201d; Erich announced. Gary had yet to learn it, but beneath the tough exterior of a German disciplined in war with nearly six years of service with the British Army, he was a sentimentalist at heart. His forty years of marriage to his recently departed wife had never produced children, and thus the ebb and flow of young interns and wide-eyed graduates had become his extended family. The honor of admission to this special club, &#x201c;Erich&#x2019;s Dreamers&#x201d;&#x2014;or, as some called them behind his back, the &#x201c;Warp Factor Club&#x201d;&#x2014;meant guidance, late-night sessions at his modest home just outside the gate, and dreams of what was and what should be. <br>The mainstream of work at Goddard now was on the beginnings of the international space station and post-Challenger recovery, and start-up on work for a second-generation shuttle design. There were even teams waiting for the word to develop a return to the moon and some talk that the president might even ask for funding of preliminary plans for Mars. But as for Erich&#x2019;s team, they were off in a far corner, their work buried deep in the yearly budget. They had been written off as dreamers&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>Some wag, as a prank, had pinned a picture of Yoda on the door with the name &#x201c;Erich&#x201d; printed across it. Rather than tear it down, Rothenberg laughed softly and let it stay. It was now faded but still there. <br>&#x201c;Erich&#x2019;s Dreamers.&#x201d; In their cramped quarters and with their marginal budget, they kept alive visions of ion drive; of solar sails that would actually use the minute pressure of sunlight and that theoretically could accelerate a payload up to a sizable fraction of light speed; of hypersonic and ramjet engines mounted on first-stage airplane-like &#x201c;carriers&#x201d; that would lift rockets to the edge of space and launch from there&nbsp;&#x2026; They even had plans&#x2014;seriously worked on back in the 1950s and now at times tweaked a bit&#x2014;to use nuclear power microburst engines that could cut the transit time to Mars from months to just weeks. <br>This had become Erich&#x2019;s domain after Apollo slipped away with barely a whimper. <br>For any ambitious graduate intern, when offered a variety of choices, the advice was to stay away from this collection of fantasists who read too much sci-fi and had seen too much <i>Star Trek</i> and could lip-synch every episode. Better to stick with the programs that had a real future, such as the next generation of the Space Shuttle, if they wanted to advance. <br>For Gary (who would not admit he could lip-synch every episode of the original <i>Star Trek</i> series), that was a challenge, not a warning, and he had specifically requested the assignment. Of the fifty-five graduate student internship applicants that summer, only two had been advised on how Erich would greet them. Before making the long trek to this office in a small out-of-the-way office complex, he knew that Erich had at least approved the interview, along with the only other intern&#x2019;s, the first exchange intern from the Ukraine, now a former member of the collapsed Soviet Union. That had caused a bit of a stir, and during his placement interview earlier in the day someone sitting in on his interview (who never identified herself) casually suggested that if he noticed anything unusual with this other intern to let security know. <br>Erich pointed to a chair, took Gary&#x2019;s dossier, thumbed through his transcripts for several minutes without comment, then started into his typical Germanic grilling. <br>&#x201c;Why in hell do you want to get into aerospace engineering when thousands of my old coworkers have been laid off and are trying to land jobs as high school teachers, and the rest are just praying to make it to retirement?&#x201d; <br>Before Gary could even form an answer, Erich fired off the next question. <br>&#x201c;Why are you even here in this office? Bright young man like you should try for the Jet Propulsion Lab out in California, or one of the private contractors like Boeing or Lockheed, and angle for a job once you graduate.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Your work intrigues me, sir,&#x201d; Gary finally replied, a bit nervously. <br>Erich sat back and shook his head, and laughed softly as he continued to thumb through Gary&#x2019;s file. <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Because I believe a day will come when humanity realizes space is the only answer left to us if we are going to make it to the twenty-second century.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why care about the twenty-second century? You plan to live that long?&#x201d; Erich laughed softly. &#x201c;I sure as hell don&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ve seen enough in this century to fill half a dozen lifetimes.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, sir, but maybe my children will. My great grandparents came to America eighty years ago. Before my grandfather died, he said they came here because of me.&#x201d; <br>Gary fell silent with that. He knew it sounded sentimental, and he had yet to realize how sentimental Erich truly was. But it was true. Three of Gary&#x2019;s four ancestors had come through Ellis Island and all spoke of the dream that brought them there: it was always about a better world for their children and grandchildren and how he should dream the same. Though only twenty-two and with all four of his grandparents gone&#x2014;along with both his parents, lost in a small plane crash two years back&#x2014;he knew that his reply to Erich&#x2019;s question would have been theirs as well. <br>His father had been a navy aviator who even tried for the astronaut corps in the mid-1960s&#x2014;and almost made it&#x2014;and this had encouraged Gary&#x2019;s fascination with flight. He actually should have been with his parents on the day they died, but a chronic sinus infection kept him home. His dad promised they&#x2019;d go up together the following week, but there was no following week. An idiotic accident&#x2014;a pilot pulled out onto the active runway just as they were touching down&#x2014;had taken both his parents. As usual with such things, the fool who caused it walked away with barely a scratch. <br>Perhaps that was why he had tried to learn to fly&#x2014;although, on the advice of his instructor, he had given it up. He didn&#x2019;t have the &#x201c;instinctive&#x201d; feel his father had, and frankly he was always on edge when aloft: that could be dangerous. Though grounded in a literal sense, his dreams were still &#x201c;up there.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Gary&#x2019;s paternal grandfather&#x2014;his beloved &#x201c;Tappy&#x201d;&#x2014;had taken over as parent until he slipped away just the year before his internship interview, truly leaving Gary alone, at least in a physical sense. Yet all of his grandparents had instilled in him &#x201c;the dream.&#x201d; Tall, gangly, rather uncoordinated&#x2014;branded a nerd by many when that term was not the compliment it would become in the Internet age&#x2014;Gary lived in a world of devouring works on aviation and space history, and at least found a few friends in the realm of fantasy gaming. Girls? That was something that left him tongue-tied and self-conscious; his friends even joked that maybe he should join a monastery, since that was the way he seemed destined to live. A favorite novel of his, Walter L. Miller Jr.&#x2019;s <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i>, did involve a religious order devoted to science, and he actually thought at times that if such an order existed, he would just give up on the rest of the world and join it. <br>Erich Rothenberg, who was five foot seven, wiry, and at best 145 pounds soaking wet, also had something of the nerd look as he continued to gaze at Gary over the rims of his glasses. But then there was the other, legendary side of the man, a commando who had survived five years of combat, been wounded three times, and had been awarded the Victoria Cross&#x2014;all before gaining his reputation as a brilliant space science engineer. No one would ever dare to apply the term &#x201c;nerd&#x201d; to him and expect to leave the office in one piece. <br>&#x201c;So Mr. Morgan, you are here because you want to save the world, is that it?&#x201d; Erich asked, but there was no mockery in his voice. <br>Gary did not answer for several seconds, then replied, &#x201c;Maybe I can help in some way, sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Then go over to the design team for the shuttle replacement.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the past, sir.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you mean? I helped with some of the design, you know.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And I read where you howled all the way, from the day they shifted the original plan from a two-stage liquid fuel launch that would take off like a plane&#x2014;and continued to voice your concerns right up to the day <i>Challenger</i> lifted off&#x2014;that putting men and women on top of solid boosters would one day end in a tragedy. And it happened.&#x201d; <br>They were both silent for a moment. <i>Challenger</i>, for everyone at NASA, was still an open wound. Gary still could not look at the footage without getting a lump in his throat when Houston radioed, &#x201c; <i>Challenger</i>, you are go at throttle up&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That is the past,&#x201d; Erich said, breaking eye contact and gazing off as if to some painful memory. <br>Gary leaned forward. He could sense that Dr. Rothenberg was showing some interest with this brief breaking down into an emotional response. <br>&#x201c;Chemical rockets are to space travel what steam trains are to magnetic levitation or even diesel electric locomotives.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Go on.&#x201d; Erich took his Zippo out again, relit his pipe, and leaned back in his chair, unflinching gaze again fixed on Gary. <br>&#x201c;Well, sir, we all know Newton&#x2019;s law about thrust and opposite reaction. Even the most efficient chemical rockets have a maximum velocity, which we are already approaching. And the fuel-weight-to-energy-produced ratio forever limits just how much we can loft up. Apollo burned millions of pounds of fuel to get less than 20,000 pounds of spacecraft into a lunar trajectory. To save weight they even shaved off a few ounces of metal on the steps leading down to the lunar surface and back. The steps were calculated to be able to hold the load at one-sixth gravity but would collapse if used on earth. To go to Mars in any reasonable amount of time&#x2014;it is a dead end, sir. Every day added because of lower velocity means that much more water, food, and other supplies for the astronauts, which means yet more weight of fuel to put it up there&nbsp;&#x2026; It is a dead end.&#x201d; <br>Erich nodded sagely then smiled. <br>&#x201c;I was the one who suggested shaving down the steps on the module to save those few ounces.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s like building a 747 to fly three people across the Atlantic,&#x201d; Gary continued, &#x201c;then junking the plane after landing.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You took that line from me, Mr. Morgan,&#x201d; Erich said, with just the hint of a smile. <br>Gary nodded, acknowledging his appropriation of what was now a much-quoted line. <br>&#x201c;So tell me, Mr. Morgan&#x201d;&#x2014;Erich looked at the file&#x2014;&#x201c;Mr. Gary Morgan: What wisdom do you bring to me, along with your youthful idealism, to solve this dilemma?&#x201d; <br>Gary hesitated. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, sir,&#x201d; he replied truthfully. &#x201c;But I do sense we are at the limits of what we can do to get into space. It is so damn frustrating, because out there limitless resources await, but we are stuck in a deep well&#x2014;the gravity well of the earth&#x2014;and it costs tens of thousands of dollars per pound just to crawl out of that well. I don&#x2019;t have the answer that fits within our realm of aerospace engineering, and that is why I volunteered to be on your team&#x2014;because maybe you do have the answer.&#x201d; <br>Erich chuckled. <br>&#x201c;Right answer. If you had said one word about folding space or wormholes&#x2014;a bunch of rubbish&#x2014;you&#x2019;d be back at Personnel. And outside this office, if you say &#x2018;warp&#x2019; even once, you are fired. I am barely hanging on to a budget as it is without some intern bubbling over in front of a jaundiced member of Congress, like one of our critics who just the other day was asking why couldn&#x2019;t NASA make fuel out of corn from his state and then he&#x2019;d support us.&#x201d; <br>Erich stared up at the ceiling, still puffing on his pipe, motioning for Gary to close the door so that there would not be any complaints while he reached back over his shoulder to open the window to air the room out. <br>&#x201c;You are right. We&#x2019;re at an ultimate dead end. The ratios of required fuel to cost to get a given number of pounds into space, combined with the risks of chemical rockets, is a paradigm that has been with us ever since my old friend Von Braun was told to start shooting V-2 rockets at London. Even he admitted that he knew the folly of it all: one rocket to deliver one ton of explosives just two hundred miles cost far more than the planes America and England were building and pounding Germany with in a thousand-plane raid every night. It was a dead end, but in Von Braun&#x2019;s case he was praying that his employer would get what he deserved and end the madness, but the rockets would become the foundation for the American victors to get into space. But the math of launching a rocket in 1944 is still the same nearly fifty years later, whether it is two hundred miles or to a translunar or trans-Mars trajectory. <br>&#x201c;So they throw a fraction of the budget, less than a tenth of one percent of the budget that finally comes to NASA, to the NIAC and a few other teams like us at JPL, White Sands, telling us to try something different&#x2014;and, of course, to come in under budget. As for you as an intern, your college gives you a small stipend so your work to us is for free, other than helping you a bit with nearby housing. But from small acorns there have been times when a mighty chestnut has grown, Mr. Morgan.&#x201d; <br>He finally made direct eye contact with Gary and smiled. <br>&#x201c;You report at 0730 every morning. I do not like these new coffee shop chains with their French names for what even we Brit soldiers called &#x2018;joe.&#x2019; There&#x2019;s a diner just down the road south of the main gate.

If he could find and make friends with the most powerful being on the Savannah, he would never have to be afraid again. His journey leads him to amazing places and a very remarkable discovery.

Kitoto, a mouse who lives on the African Savannah, looks for a force strong enough to protect him from a hawk. The river sends him to the sun. The sun informs him that the wind is more powerful, but the wind tells him that she is not mighty enough to move the mountain. The mountain tells him to search for the creature "who chomps away at my root." Kitoto enters the mountain and is surprised to discover Kigego, a little gray mouse who promises to teach him the secrets of the ground, as Kitoto will show her the secrets of the Savannah. Like Eric Kimmel's version of this tale, The Greatest of All (Holiday, 1991), Kitoto challenges readers to decide how greatness might be measured. While Kimmel tells of a father who seeks the best husband for his daughter, Mollel's mouse is a weak male who seeks the most powerful being and finds a female who epitomizes the essence of strength?one who performs the tasks necessary for survival. Frost's illustrations capture the warm colors of the African Savannah, its topography, and its animals. The close-ups of Kitoto and the personified elements of nature are exceptional.

Threatened with death, Northup was forced to assume a new name and fake past. Taken to Louisiana on a disease-ridden plague ship, he was initially sold to a cotton planter. In the&nbsp;12 years that followed he was sold to many different owners who treated him with varying levels of savagery, including forced labor, scant food, and numerous beatings. Eventually Northup succeeded in contacting Samuel Bass, a white carpenter whom he knew to be sympathetic to the cause of black people. Bass contacted Northup's family and together they gained the necessary paperwork to travel to Louisiana to retrieve him. Northup pressed charges against his captors but in a triumph of irony the case was heard in Washington&#x2014;meaning that as a black man he could not testify against the accused (in the end they were able to countersue him.) A true-life testament to tremendous courage and tenacity in the face of unfathomable injustice, Northup's account is also of extreme interest due to the meticulous recordings of slave life. Unique in its firsthand nature, the book became a runaway bestseller.</p></p><p>This story of the abduction of a free Negro adult from the North and his enslavement in the South--provides a sensational element which cannot be matched in any of the dozens of narratives written by former slaves. &#39;Think of it: For thirty years a man, wit all man&#39;s hopes, fears and aspirations--with a wife and children to call him by the endearing names of husband and father--with a home, humble it may be, but still a home...then for twelve years a thing, a chattel personal, classed with mules and horses....Oh! it is horrible.

In <i>Piercing</i>, Murakami, in his own unique style, explores themes of child abuse and what happens to the voiceless among us, weaving a disturbing, spare tale of two people who find each other and then are forced into hurting each other deeply because of the haunting specter of their own abuse as children.<br><br></p></p><p>Ryu Murakami, musician, filmmaker, TV talk show host, and novelist, is the author of <b>Almost Transparent Blue</b>, <b>69</b>, and <b>Coin Locker Babies</b>, which the <b>Washington Post</b> praised as "a knockout . . . a great big pulsating parable."Kawashima survived a hideously abusive childhood and, as isn't unusual in such cases, bears the scars. Voices in his head, accompanied by garish images, urge him to re-create his stabbing, when a teenager, of the stripper who was his brutal mother. Because "only voices and images from the external world could neutralize those from inside," Kawashima's greatest fear is not of death but of blindness and deafness. When fantasies of stabbing his infant daughter as she sleeps in her crib start to dominate his consciousness, he lies to his unsuspecting wife, takes a hotel room, and meticulously plots to murder an S&amp;M prostitute--who is petite, so he can more easily overcome her. Certainly not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, <i>Piercing</i> blends a cold-blooded true-crime ambience and unexpected, almost antic humor as best-laid plans go horribly awry when an equally scarred (she's a compulsive cutter) abuse survivor turned S&amp;M prostitute enters the action. Oddly and thoroughly compelling as well as chilling, and neither black comedy nor horror, this is a strangely entertaining novel. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

"And I hate it." He did not know what to say. It all stuck in his throat, everything he had planned that afternoon walking home from the store. "We use it, you see," she told him. "My women and I. We must." He nodded. "Women do use love, of course. But so do men, and men usually use it worse. Don't you think that only proves it's real? If it wasn't, nobody could use it." The brandy had gone to his head; by the time he had finished speaking, he was no longer quite sure what they had been talking about. "It's real, all right," Lara told him. "But I am not a woman." "A girl--" He was groping. So was she, a hand in his pajamas. "A lady." His glass was at his lips. He took it from her hand and drank. " ... and then the men die. Always. She holds his sperm, saves it, and bears his children, one after another for the rest of her life. Perhaps three children. Perhaps three dozen." "I love you," he said thickly. "I'd die for you, Lara." "But this is better--your way is so much better. Now I'll go back. Listen. There are doors--" She did not go back at once. They embraced again, on the floor in front of the gas log. For the second time that evening he poured himself into her. And afterward he held her to him, tightly, oh, so tightly, feeling as though the two of them were in a boat upon the sea, a little boat that rocked and spun with every billow; that only his body against hers, her body against his could save them both from freezing in the freezing spume. "You must be careful," she said when he was almost asleep. "Because we've been so close." &nbsp; <br> He woke up with a throbbing headache. Sunlight was pouring through the window; from its angle he knew that he had missed work that day. He got up and made himself drink three glasses of water. Lara was gone, but that was to be expected; it was nearly eleven. She had probably gone out to look for a job, or to get some clothes, maybe even to get some lunch. He called the store. "Flu--came on last night. Sorry, so sorry I didn't call in sooner." I sound like a Jap, he thought. Too long selling Sonys. Ella in Personnel said, "I'll mark you down. Don't feel bad--it's your first sick day this year." Aspirin, he thought. You're supposed to take aspirin. He swallowed three. There was a note on the coffee table, a note in Lara's angular writing. Darling, I tried to say good-bye last night, but you wouldn't listen. I'm not a coward, really I'm not. If it weren't for the doors I wouldn't tell you a thing--that would be the best way. You may see one, perhaps more than one, at least for a little while. It will be closed all around. (They must be closed on all sides.) It may be a real door, or just something like a guy-wire supporting a phone pole, or an arch in a garden. Whatever it is, it will look <i>significant.</i> Please read carefully. Please remember everything I'm saying. <i>You must not go through.</i> If you go through before you realize it, don't turn around. <i>If you do it will be gone. Walk backward at once.</i> Lara PS: You always put these on, don't you? At the end. At the end, I loved you. I really did. (Do.) He read it three times and put it down, feeling that it was wrong, that something important had been left out, that his eyes had followed four smokestacks down to three chimneys. Was that underlined word really <i>significant</i>, and if so, just what did it signify? It might be <i>signature.</i> He stuck his head under the shower and let the icy water beat his hair and the back of his neck full force. When he had stood there (bent, a hand braced against the tile) for so long that the slow drain had allowed the tub to fill, he washed his face seven times, shaved, and felt better. If he went out, there was a chance that somebody from the store would see him; but it was a chance he would have to take.Knotting his brown tie, he studied the door of the apartment. It did not look significant, though perhaps it was. Capini's was only a block and a half. He had a glass of red wine with his linguine, and either the wine or the linguine made him feel almost normal. But Mama Capini was gone or back in the kitchen, and it was Mama Capini he would have to talk to. There were three or four sons--he had never learned their names--but they were not likely to tell him anything. Mama Capini might, and he decided to come back for dinner. Meanwhile, the police, the morgue ... &nbsp; <br> "I'm looking for a woman," he told the gray-haired, buck-toothed woman at the Downtown Mental Health Center who saw him at last. And then, because that sounded so dirty, he added, "A particular woman." "And you think we might know where she is?" He nodded. "What was her name?" "Lara Morgan." He spelled it. "I don't know if that was her real name or not. I never saw any identification." "Then we'll hold off running it through the computer for a moment. Can you describe her?" "About five foot nine. Red hair to her shoulder blades. Dark red. Auburn, is that what you call it?" The buck-toothed woman nodded. "Very pretty--beautiful, in fact. Viridian eyes. A lot of little freckles. A buttermilk complexion, you know what I mean? I doubt if I'm much good at estimating women's weight, but maybe a hundred and twenty pounds." "Viridian, Mr ... ?" "Green--viridian's a bluish green. You'll have to excuse it. Isell tape decks and so on now, but I used to be in small appliances. Viridian has more blue than avocado." "I see. And how was this woman dressed the last time you saw her?" He bit back the impulse to say she wasn't. "A green dress. Silk I guess, or maybe it was nylon. High-heeled boots, I think lizard, though they might have been snake. A gold necklace and a couple of gold bracelets--she wore a lot of gold jewelry. A black fur coat with a hood. Maybe it was fake, but it looked and felt real to me." The buck-toothed woman said, "We haven't seen her, Mr. Green. If someone who looked and dressed like that had come here, I'd know about her. If she's seeing someone, which I doubt, it's a private psychiatrist. What makes you think she may be disturbed?" "The way she acted. Things she said." "And how did she act, Mr. Green?" He considered. "Like, she didn't know about ice-makers. She went to the refrigerator one time to get ice--she was going to make lemonade--and she came back and said there wasn't any. So I went and showed her how it worked, and she said, 'How nice, all these little blocks."' The buck-toothed woman frowned, putting her hands together fingertip to fingertip like a man. "Surely there must have been something more than that." "Well, she was afraid that somebody was going to take her back. That's what she told me." The buck-toothed woman's expression said now we're getting someplace. She leaned toward him as she spoke. "Take her back where, Mr. Green?" He started to ask how she knew his name (he had refused togive it to the temporary receptionist) but he thought better of it. "She didn't say, Doctor. Through the doors, I guess." "The doors?" "She talked about doors. This was just before she left--the doors, or one door anyway, that was how she got here. If they came to take her back, they'd pull her through a door, so she was going to go on her own first." When the buck-toothed woman offered no comment, he added, "At least, that was the way it seemed to me." "These doors would appear to indicate an institution of some kind, then," the buck-toothed woman said. "That's how they sounded to me." "Has it struck you that the institution might be a prison, Mr. Green?" He shook his head. "She didn't seem that way. She seemed, well, smart. But a little disconnected." "Intelligent people who've been institutionalized often do. I take it she was about your own age?" He nodded. "And you are ... ?" "Thirty." "Then let us say this beautiful woman who calls herself Lara Morgan is thirty also. If she had committed a serious offense in her teens--a murder, perhaps, or if she'd had some complicity in a murder--she would have been sent to a girls' correctional center until she was of age, and then transferred to a women's prison to complete her sentence. Thus she might easily have spent the last ten or twelve years in one or the other, Mr. Green." He began, "I don't think--" "You see, Mr. Green, escapees from our mental hospitals are not punished. They are ill, and one does not punish illness. Butprisoners--criminals--who escape are punished. I'm glad that you've come back to us, Mr. Green. I was getting rather worried about you." &nbsp; <br> He was shaking when he left the Center; he had not really known he cared about Lara so much. The Downtown Mental Health Center stood on one corner of a five-way intersection. The five streets were all congested, and when he looked down each they seemed to spin around him like the spokes of a wheel, each thronged, each noisy, each straight and running to infinity, thronged, noisy, and congested. None was like the rest; nor were any--when he looked again--exactly the way they had been when he had come in. Hadn't that theater been a bowling alley? And weren't fire trucks supposed to be red, buses yellow, or maybe orange? Were the doors here? "It may be something like a guy-wire supporting a telephone pole." That was what Lara had written.

But things haven't been going great lately for the p.i.'s burly ex-hero. First came the honeymoon boating accident that killed Heck's son and new daughter-in-law, Allison. And now the big man himself is dying--struck down by a runaway truck at an ungodly hour in a section of Seattle where no decent citizen should be caught dead.<p>But Waterman's not so sure Allison went down with the ship. And if his motley, aging legmen, "the Boys," can gather the facts, perhaps he can prove it--following the lead to the Midwest and a missing million dollars. . .and maybe to a "black widow" who may be less "late" and more lethal than anyone ever suspected.</p></p><p><p>G.M.

A former creative writing teacher in western Washington, Ford lives in Oregon and is currently working on his next novel.</p>Years and years ago, stunning Marge Sundstrom broke up the gaggle of hangers-on and friends her new husband Heck, commercial fisherman of the Lady Day, had gathered around him. Now it's Marge who needs the solace of friends, with her son Nicky killed in a boating accident, and his grief-stricken father hospitalized after getting hit by a car he didn't bother to avoid. The records list a third casualty--Nicky's bride, Allison Stark, who steamrolled Nicky the same way Marge had steamrolled Heck--but Marge doesn't believe for a minute that Allison's dead, and she wants Leo Waterman, one of the original Lady Day alumni, to hunt her down. And hunt he does, in an odyssey that takes him from his old haunts at Seattle's fisherman's wharf--where he picks up the trail of still another untidy disappearance--to the wilds of Wisconsin, from a bilked realtor to a football player-turned- televangelist, each with a shivery tale to tell about the chameleon last seen in the guise of Allison Stark Sundstrom. Together with his aging Irregulars, who like detecting more than anything but drinking, Leo follows each twist and bump in this fatal femme's life story till the predictable, but highly effective, finale.

He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1978.More Stories from My Father's Court <br> CHAIM THE LOCKSMITH &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> Although everyone called him Chaim the locksmith, he was actually what we here in America call a plumber. He repaired water pipes, especially clogged toilet lines, a frequent problem in our street. Chaim was a man of middling height, strong and broad-shouldered, with a face brown as bronze and a beard to match. His clothes seemed to be dusted with rust. Although he was still young, his face had the lines and wrinkles of a laboring man who does not spare himself. Summer and winter he wore a short jacket and high boots. He always carried pipes, hammers, files, pliers, and odd pieces of iron. Even his voice had a metallic twang. On Sabbath, Chaim the locksmith prayed in our apartment and ate the Third Sabbath Meal with us. Sometimes, while drinking a tumbler of brandy, he would shake my hand. His hand was hard as iron. Aside from fixing toilets, Chaim was summoned wherever there was trouble: a fire, a collapsed ceiling, a stuck door, a broken oven. He was the only one who didn't mind getting smearedwith ashes and soot. He burdened himself with other onerous tasks as well. In addition to being part of the group that prayed in our apartment, Chaim belonged to the Sleepover Volunteers, whose members would spend nights with the sick. After a hard day's work, Chaim was sent to care for people suffering from typhus or delirium who needed the help of a strong man. God had blessed Chaim with strength, and with it he served God. When people begged Chaim not to exhaust himself, he would shrug his shoulders and reply, "If you're given broad shoulders, you must bear the burden." Chaim the locksmith had a few daughters; his youngest child was a boy about nine or ten years older than I, named Zanvel. Chaim's love for his only son was boundless. I never heard him speak of anything but the boy: Zanvel can already read syllables, Zanvel has just started the Five Books of Moses, Zanvel has begun studying Gemara. Chaim had already decided that Zanvel must be a scholar and become a rabbi. Whenever Chaim visited us he would say, "My Zanvele will be a rabbi." "God willing," Father replied. "I just want to live to see one thing--my Zanvele deciding rabbinic questions." This wasn't merely a wish; it was the only hope on which Chaim the locksmith's efforts were focused. He sent Zanvel to study with the best teachers; early on, he dressed him in Hasidic clothing. Chaim paid a young Hasid to watch over him, study with him, and discuss Torah and Hasidic rebbes with him. Zanvel displayed a love of learning; yet with his fair skin, blue eyes, and blond sidecurls, he resembled his mother, not hisfather. With his thin, high-pitched voice, it was hard to believe that he was Chaim's son. Chaim brought Zanvel to Father for an oral examination each Sabbath. Mother would offer him fruit, and as Zanvel sat with us, wearing a cap and a belted satin gaberdine, Father would discuss Hasidic matters with him. A bit farther away sat the locksmith, his face shining with an otherworldly joy. His bronzed face seemed to melt with pleasure, and the eyes beneath his bushy brows were filled with light. Perhaps such was the happiness of the Jews at Mount Sinai when God revealed Himself amid fire. When Chaim's wife complained that he paid scant attention to his daughters, he would defend himself by saying, Don't I love the girls? He loved them more than his own life. But after all, girls cannot study Torah. They run around in the courtyard and are interested only in clothing, trifles, and nonsense. How could Chaim compare the joy the girls gave him with that of Zanvel? Zanvel sat over a Talmud and his little voice echoed throughout the courtyard. In the study house respectable Jews came and discussed a bit of Gemara with him. One hundred years from now Zanvel would recite the Kaddish after Chaim's death. And what's more, Zanvel was weak and gentle, a silken lad. The girls resembled him, Chaim. Indeed, it was true. The girls had brown faces, thick braids, high chests. They sang plaintive songs about the <i>Titanic</i> and about various love affairs. On Sabbaths they cracked pumpkin seeds at the gate of the apartment house and secretly went to the movies. So how could they be compared to little Zanvel? Just yesterday Zanvel was a cheder lad--and now he was already on the threshold of young adulthood. He studied Torahwith my father and attended Talmud lectures given by some head of a yeshiva. He was awarded a nickel-plated watch for his mastery of fifty pages of Talmud. This was the time when yeshiva students strayed from the straight and narrow path, reading newspapers and perusing forbidden secular books. In our house we feared for Zanvel. Everyone knew that if Zanvel stumbled, the heart of that strong Jew, Chaim the locksmith, would burst like an overfilled balloon. Chaim would have been able to withstand any blow, except a tragedy involving Zanvel. But, thank God, Zanvel did not go down the crooked path. He craved studying, swayed during prayers, and in time also went to see a Hasidic rebbe. One day, Chaim the locksmith came to us and declared, "My Zanvel is in Gur ... at the rebbe's court." And he humbly bent his head as if silently wondering, Why am I worthy of such joy? Do I deserve it? It's unbelievable ... incredible! When the First World War began and Zanvel had to report to the draft board, it was a catastrophe for Chaim the locksmith. If Zanvel was sent to the barracks and to the front, all his plans would be ruined. Chaim wandered around distraught, his face no longer brown but black as a chimney sweep's. Some suggested that Zanvel should injure himself just enough to make him unfit for military service. But Chaim couldn't bear the idea that Zanvel would somehow be disfigured. In his mind Zanvel was like a Temple sacrifice which had to be absolutely without blemish. After a while Chaim the locksmith decided to place Zanvel in hiding instead. He found a garret where Zanvel sat and studied for days on end. He did not set foot on the street, lest he beasked for identity papers. Chaim the locksmith himself watched out for an inspector who might enter the courtyard. Chaim was careful, his wife was careful, his daughters were careful. The entire courtyard was on the alert. In the meantime, Zanvel sat surrounded by books and studied. He drank tea, swayed, hummed some melody, and ate the food his mother brought him. Then Warsaw was beset by inflation and Chaim the locksmith had little work. The poor people of the neighborhood could no longer afford to have their toilets fixed. But Chaim's meager income provided soups and grits and fresh little rolls for his little Zanvel. For under no circumstances should a young man sitting in a prisonlike setting and studying Torah suffer any want. When the Germans entered Warsaw, Zanvel no longer had to hide from the gentile authorities. He was free to come and go as he pleased, and Chaim the locksmith made a banquet. By now Zanvel had a little blond beard; he had straightened up, developed a long neck, sunken cheeks, and a pointy Adam's apple, which bobbed up and down his throat. He already spoke with a rabbinic intonation. Many pious Jews and religious functionaries gathered at the banquet--which ruined Chaim the locksmith. He had no income of his own, and he had to sell, pawn, and deprive himself and his daughters of their last bite of food. At this banquet Zanvel delivered a quibbling, hair-splitting discourse and debated some recondite Talmudic points with the scholars present. Chaim the locksmith laughed and cried. Chaim began to look bad. First of all, he didn't have enough to eat. Second, his daughters, who had started down a slipperyslope, caused him anguish. And finally, the fear that something might happen to Zanvel finished him off. Chaim coughed and his back bent over as if under a heavy burden. He was urged to see a doctor, to get some fresh air in the countryside. But Chaim the locksmith just laughed. "What else should I do? Eat marzipan candy?" A match was soon arranged for Zanvel; the bride-to-be was a rabbi's daughter. The bride's family was usually responsible for the dowry, but when a rabbi agrees to a match with a locksmith, he wants to be paid. Chaim had no money but promised a dowry, so when the Germans began building a railroad nearby and he heard they needed locksmiths, mechanics, and metal workers, Chaim the locksmith went off to work for the Germans. His wife came to us crying that Chaim was killing himself. He labored outside in the freezing cold, in snowstorms and downpours. Workers were dropping like flies. Chaim was doing the work of three men. When he managed to come home for a day, his appearance frightened his family. He was no longer brown or black--but yellow. White hairs threaded his beard. His voice was hoarse and he coughed like a consumptive. My father warned Chaim that it is forbidden to sacrifice oneself for the sake of some dowry or prestigious lineage, and that one's life and well-being take precedence over everything else. Father took a volume of the <i>Code of Law</i> from a bookshelf and showed Chaim that when a pregnant woman is about to give birth, everyone is permitted to violate the Sabbath for her, even though one person would suffice. Such is the value that the Torah places on a human life. But Chaim the locksmith answered, "Rabbi, the devil won't take me." Zanvel became engaged, and the party cost plenty of German marks. Once Zanvel married, Chaim again spent a fortune. Then came the good news: Zanvel had been offered a rabbinic position in a small shtetl. That would be the last time Chaim visited our apartment. He came in, positioned himself in the doorway, and began to sing like someone in a Purim costume: "Mazel tov! Zanvel is a rabbi!" he called out, and then began to cry. He seized Father's hand and kissed it. "Zanvel may be a rabbi, but ...</p><h2>Getting Started in Sailboat Racing</h2><p><p>A complete course in the fundamentals, <i>Getting Started in Sailboat Racing</i> dispels the sport&#x2019;s elite aura and makes racing accessible to any sailor who wants to give it a try.

Her people worshipped the day. Her duties in the village of Sky Flames were concerned with offering comfort to her people and carrying out ceremonies in praise of the sun. She could do no magic now. She knew this to be true&#x2014;for it was the middle of the day.<br><br>Her spells worked only at night.<br><br>Ginger opened her hand and stared at the fire opal on her palm. Such a dangerous gem. Her grandfather had given her the foursided pyramid on her fifth birthday.Years ago, she had discovered it allowed her to create spells of heat and light. She had never heard of anyone with such abilities. No one knew about her power; she guarded that secret as she would her own life. It would be dangerous enough if her people suspected she could do spells; if they realized she could do them <i>only</i> at night, gods only knew how they would deal with that trespass against her calling to the dragon.<br><br>"Ginger-Sun?" a man called, using the honorific that named her as a priestess. "Come quick!"<br><br>His urgent tone jolted her.Whoever called couldn't enter here; this chamber was forbidden to all but the priestess. As she opened the door, the rumble of men talking rolled over her.The presence of so many rough voices unsettled Ginger. She felt suddenly conscious of her vulnerability; this building was a ten-minute walk from the village and she lived alone.<br><br>Ginger entered the main temple, a large room with a roof of inverted terraces high above her head. A fountain bubbled nearby, fed from the village irrigation system, and a statue of the dragon stood within it, his wings spread. Instead of fire, he breathed water. It rose into the air from his upturned head and cascaded down his <br><br>Across the room, five men had gathered by the wall.They wore coarse trousers, shirts and boots encrusted with sand.The sun had weathered their faces, and heavy muscles corded their arms.Tools hung from their belts.They had shovels strapped to their backs&#x2014;and massive axes.<br><br>Ginger's pulse leapt.Why did they want her? She took a breath, steeling herself. Her calling required she tend anyone who came to the temple, no matter how threatening. She walked toward them, seeking to appear calm, though sweat dampened her palms. Her bare feet made no sound on the floor. She wore the traditional garb of a priestess, a gold silk wrap that fit her snugly from neck to ankle and constrained the size of her steps.<br><br>As she reached the group, a stocky man with gnarled muscles spun around and grasped the handle of the axe sticking up over his shoulder. Ginger gulped, her gaze fixed on the blade as he pulled it above his shoulder.<br><br>Then he paused, and the clenched set of his face eased. With a start, she recognized him as Harjan, who had been a friend of her parents before they passed away. Now that she could see the others better, she realized they were miners who worked the ore flats outside the village.They kept watch over the temple,too,for her protection.The relief that washed over her was so intense,it felt visceral.<br><br>Harjan lowered his arm."My apology for disturbing your evening, Priestess."<br><br>"Are you all right, Jan?" she asked. His pallor worried her. Behind the miners, someone was lying on a stone ledge that jutted out from the wall. A makeshift litter lay on the floor, and blood stained the men's clothes.The miners averted their gazes more than usual when she looked at them.<br><br>"Has there been an accident?" she asked.<br><br>"Not an accident," Harjan said. "This man was stabbed."<br><br>"We didn't want to bring him here, Priestess," another man said with a look of apology. "But only you can do the rites."<br><br>Ah, no. They wouldn't have come to her if the man lived; the village had another healer who treated the men. But only Ginger to walk among the dead.<br><br>Afraid of what she would find, she walked forward, and the miners moved aside. A large man lay on the shelf. She sat next to in his midthirties, with a square chin and strong nose, but that was all she could see. Bruises covered his face, and deep gashes had gored his torso, his arms, even his legs. Blood soaked his clothes. She pulled away scraps of his shirt and winced as coagulated blood smeared her hand.The ragged pattern of his wounds told a gruesome tale, that he had fought hard against his assailants&#x2014;and lost the battle.<br><br>"Gods," someone muttered. "Why would anyone do this?" A tear ran down Ginger's face."Only the Dragon-Sun can answer that." She couldn't imagine how he could burn in the sky while such a monstrous crime took place below him. "Do any of you know this man?"<br><br>"Never seen the poor bastard," another man answered."We don't know what happened."<br><br>"I'm sorry we had to show you this," Harjan said.<br><br>She looked up at him through a mist of tears. "You were right to bring him."<br><br>"Ach, Ginger-Sun." He lifted his hand as if to lay it on her shoulder, offering comfort, but he stopped himself in time, before he touched her.<br><br>"Could you bring him to the Sunset Chamber?" Her voice trembled. If she didn't perform the rites before sundown, the man's spirit could be condemned to wander the site of his murder until his killers died. onto the litter and carried it across the temple, past the RayLight Chamber, which no longer glowed now that the sun was too low in the sky.<br><br>At the far wall, Ginger opened an arched door with a window at its apex that depicted the setting sun.The floor, walls and ceiling in the chamber beyond were bare stone in the red and ochre hues of the desert, a stark but fitting memorial to those who lost their lives in this harsh land. Here the dead received their blessing before their spirit traveled to the realms beyond. chamber.The only light came from slits where the ceiling met the walls, and shadows were filling the room as the day aged into night. She hoped she could complete the rites in time; otherwise she would have to remain here all night with the corpse, to ensure its spirit didn't become trapped in the realm of the living.<br><br>Harjan was watching her. "We can stay."<br><br>His offer touched her, but they both knew she had to refuse. If she allowed the uninitiated to stay while she performed the rites, she risked stirring the wrath of the Dragon-Sun.<br><br>"Thank you." Her voice caught. "But it isn't necessary."<br><br>He twisted his big hands in his sleeves. "It's not right you should have to face this alone."<br><br>"I must."<br><br>"But you're so young."<br><br>She almost smiled at that. He had always been a big bear of a man with a kind heart. But she would celebrate her eighteenth year in only a few tendays, which put her two years past the age when young people were considered adults.<br><br>"I'll be fine," she told him, though she wasn't sure who she wanted to convince, Harjan or herself.<br><br>He nodded with reluctance. He and the other men bowed and quietly took their leave, closing the door behind them.<br><br>Ginger sagged against the wall. Despite her assurances, she feared offering succor to the people of Sky Flames, who eked out lives in the harshly beautiful desert. She gave blessings, performed rituals to honor the sun, presided at marriages and christenings, comforted mourners, listened to those who needed to talk and tended the health of women and children. It was a calling she loved, one well suited to her. She needed to perform the Sunset Rites less often than other ceremonies, and she had never done them for someone who had suffered such a brutal death.<br><br>Ginger drew herself up, determined to do well by this man's spirit. She went to a wall niche and lit the fire-lily candles there.Their spicy scent wafted around her, and in their flickering light, the scrolled carvings on the walls seemed to ripple.As she picked up a bundle of cloths, she realized she was clenching her opal. Startled, she set it down.Then she changed her mind and took it up again. The opal gave her a sense of confidence, which right now she very much needed.<br><br>One of the candles sputtered and died, and a tendril of smoke curled in the air. She thought of doing a flame spell, then shook her head, angry at herself, and relit the candle from one still burning. In her childhood, she had discovered by accident that she could do fire spells by concentrating on the opal, but she didn't understand why it happened. She used her abilities rarely and strove to do only good with them, but deep inside she feared they were a curse.<br><br>Ginger took the bowl of water in the niche and a soap carved like trip to the spirit lands. She returned to the table and looked down at his ravaged face. Softly she said,"May you have more peace among the spirits than you had among the living."<br><br>The dead man opened his eyes.</p><h2>Essential bonsai: The complete handbook for creating and growing your own bonsai</h2><p>This practical and handy guide is packed with projects on how to grow and care for these miniature trees.</p><p>Ken Norman has a renowned private collection of bonsai on permanent display in Sussex, England.

Erotica: The Siege of Adam &amp; Eve</h2><p>In 1986, a small mail-order company was invaded by 37 armed law enforcement agents who instantly shut down all operations, herded the employees into a warehouse, and then systematically interrogated everyone, allowing them to leave only after subpoenas were distributed. Although this episode may sound like a police action in the former East Germany, in fact it was implemented by the U.S. Justice Department, then headed by Edwin Meese, against Adam &amp; Eve, a North Carolina business that sells contraceptives, sex toys, and adult videos. Owner Phil Harvey's first-hand account of this David-and-Goliath battle goes to the heart of our national debate over First Amendment freedom of expression versus government attempts to limit the availability of erotic materials.Harvey not only writes a personal memoir of his harrowing struggle against the strong-arm tactics of the Justice Department; he also raises important questions about federal abuse of power, the slow erosion of First Amendment rights through government intimidation, the effects of pornography, archaic laws that attempt to regulate sexuality between consenting adults, the class-war implications of this battle, and the interplay between sex and religion. In the end the courts ruled against the Justice Department's actions, but only because Harvey chose to resist an eight-year siege by a government bent on imposing its moral agenda by force.This fascinating story is a wake-up call for all who would be complacent about First Amendment rights.</p><p>Harvey&#39;s account of his eight-year battle with the Justice Department has been nominated for the Eli M.

She lost almost everyone she loved, including her mother, who committed suicide, and her father&#x2019;s merciless purges claimed the lives of aunts and uncles, and her lover, who was exiled to Siberia.</p><p>After her father&#x2019;s death, Svetlana discovered the extent of his cruelty. Balking at the control the Kremlin still exerted over her life, she shocked the world by defecting to the United States at the height of the Cold War&#x2014;leaving behind two children. However, in America Svetlana found only more heartbreak. For a time, Frank Lloyd Wright&#x2019;s Taliesin community, overseen by his controversial third wife, Olgivanna, formed a second family for her; Svetlana married Wesley Peters, a member of the inner circle, and they had a child. But Olgivanna manipulated their friendship for financial gain, and the marriage disintegrated.

Born in Chicago, he attended Northwestern University, and upon graduation went to work for the Associated Press, beginning a lifelong career in journalism that would include long periods at the Chicago Tribune and Advertising Age. While at the Tribune, Goldsborough began writing mysteries in the voice of Rex Stout, the creator of iconic sleuths Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin. Goldsborough&#x2019;s first novel starring Wolfe, Murder in E Minor (1986), was met with acclaim both from critics and devoted fans, winning a Nero Award from the Wolfe Pack. Six more novels followed, including Death on Deadline (1987) and Fade to Black (1990). In 2005, Goldsborough published Three Strikes You&#x2019;re Dead, the first in an original series starring Chicago Tribune reporter Snap Malek. His most recent novel is Terror at the Fair (2011).Goldsborough's Murder in E Minor authentically revived the late Rex Stout's famed Nero Wolfe and company, busy again in this appealing sequel. The unbeatable sleuth's trusty assistant, Archie Goodwin, tells of events Wolfe investigates without stirring from his Manhattan brownstone. Convinced that elderly Harriet Haverhill was murdered, the detective disputes the official verdict of suicide. Proud of her family-owned newspaper, the Gazette, Haverhill had rejected lucrative offers from a sleazy tycoon who wants to turn the daily into another of his sensationalistic scandal sheets. Mrs. Haverhill's kin and other stockholders seem eager to sell out, however, and Wolfe intends to prove that one of them is a killer for profit. He does, as Archie assembles all concerned to hear the great man pronounce judgment, ending a dandy story. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Bacon: a Savor the South cookbook (Savor the South Cookbooks)</h2><p>From the earliest days of European settlement in the South, as in many rural economies around the globe, cured pork became a main source of sustenance, and the cheaper, lower-on-the-hog cuts--notably, bacon--became some of the most important traditional southern foodstuffs. In this cookbook, Fred Thompson captures a humble ingredient's regional culinary history and outsized contributions to the table. Delicious, of course, straight out of the skillet, bacon is also special in its ability to lend a unique savory smokiness to an enormous range of other foods.<br><br>Today, for regular eaters and high-flying southern chefs alike, bacon has achieved a culinary profile so popular as to approach baconmania. But Thompson sagely notes that bacon will survive the silliness. Describing the many kinds of bacon that are available, Thompson provides key choices for cooking and seasoning appropriately. The book's fifty-six recipes invariably highlight and maximize that beloved bacon factor, so appreciated throughout the South and beyond (by Thompson's count, fifty different styles of bacon exist worldwide). Dishes range from southern regional to international, from appetizers to main courses, and even to a very southern beverage. Also included are Thompson's do-it-yourself recipes for making bacon from fresh pork belly in five different styles.<br><br></p><p>Fred Thompson, well-known cookbook author and editor of <i>Edible Piedmont</i> magazine, is the author of <i>Fred Thompson's Southern Sides: 250 Dishes That Really Make the Plate</i>, among other books.A worthy addition to the Savor the South series, Fred Thompson's <i>Bacon</i> features a grand collection of crowd-pleasing recipes and opens doors for cooks to understand the somewhat complex subject of bacon--the world beyond the prepacked bacon section at the local supermarket.--Carroll Leggett, food writer<br>Fred Thompson is a fine culinary teacher who explains the different types of bacon and how they vary by region and country with precision.

He is also one of the first Americans to introduce a critique of popular culture and an examination of language into the visual arts. Although he first made his reputation as a painter, Ruscha is also celebrated for his drawings (made both with conventional materials and with food, blood, gunpowder, and shellac), prints, films, photographs, and books. He is often associated with Los Angeles as a Pop and Conceptualist hub, but tends to regard such labels with a satirical, if not jaundiced, eye. Indeed, his work is characterized by the tensions between high and low, solemn and irreverent, and serious and nonsensical, and it draws on popular culture as well as Western art traditions.<br> <br> <i>Leave Any Information at the Signal</i> not only documents the work of this influential artist as he rose to prominence but also contains his writings and commentaries on other artistic developments of the period. The book is divided into three parts, each of which is arranged chronologically. Part one contains statements, letters, and other writings. Part two consists of more than fifty interviews, some of which have never before been published or translated into English. Part three contains sketchbook pages, word groupings, and other notes that chart how Ruscha develops ideas and solves artistic problems. They are published here for the first time.

The gods themselves used it for creating the world, granting humankind magical powers as an aid to the struggle for existence. Magic formed a link between human beings, gods, and the dead. Magicians were the indispensable guardians of the god-given cosmic order, learned scholars who were always searching for the Magic Book of Thoth, which could explain the wonders of nature.<br>Egyptian Magic, illustrated with wonderful and mysterious objects from European museum collections, describes how Egyptian sorcerers used their craft to protect the weakest members of society, to support the gods in their fight against evil, and to imbue the dead with immortality, and explores the arcane systems and traditions of the occult that governed this well-organized universe of ancient Egypt.</p><p>Maarten J.

This was ten years ago, and we had both been off alcohol for more than a decade. We were disagree�ing about the best way to stay sober when my mother said, &#x2018;I think we should write a book about alcoholism.&#x2019; <br> <br>&#x201c;I sat back. &#x2018;We?&#x2019; <br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2018;Both of us. Two points of view.&#x2019;&#x201d; &#x2014;from the Foreword <br> <br>Double Double is a unique, dual memoir of alcoholism, a disease that affects nearly 45 million Americans each year. People who suffer from alcoholism as well as their families and friends know that while it is possible to get sober, there is no one &#x201c;right&#x201d; way to do this. <br> <br>Now, award-winning mystery writer Martha Grimes and her son, Ken Grimes, offer two points of view on their struggles with alcoholism. In alternating chapters, they share their stories&#x2014;stories of drinking, recovery, relapse, friendship, travel, work, success, and failure. <br> <br>For Martha, it was about drinking martinis at home, sometimes with friends, sometimes alone. For Ken, it was partying in bars and clubs. Each hit bottom. Martha spent time doing outpatient reha�bilitation, once in 1990 and again two years later. Ken began twelve-step recovery. This candid memoir describes how different both the disease and the recovery can look in two different people&#x2014;even two people who are mother and son. <br> <br>Double Double is an intensely personal and illuminating book, filled with insights, humor, a little self-deprecation, and a lot of self-evaluation. Anyone who has faced alcoholism will identify with parts of this book. All readers will find these pages revealing, moving, and compelling.</p><p>Bestselling author Martha Grimes is the author of more than thirty books, including twenty-two Richard Jury mysteries.

Or a very, very dry double martini.<br> <br>I came of age in the &#x201c;Just Say Yes&#x201d; generation of the late 1970s and the early 1980s, between the end of the freewheeling 1960s&#x2014;an era that my friends and I adored but which wasn&#x2019;t ours&#x2014;and the dawning of Nancy Reagan&#x2019;s &#x201c;Just Say No&#x201d; decade of merciless greed and cocaine consumption.<br> <br>How did I stop? With more than a little help from my friends. By going to meetings in recovery and finding people who are as crazy as I am. I&#x2019;ve been sober for two decades and I&#x2019;m still trying to change the saying &#x201c;I may not be much, but I&#x2019;m all I think about.&#x201d;<br> <br>The literature of recovery says that letting go of the bondage of self is the only way to achieve that &#x201c;priceless gift of serenity.&#x201d; Serenity from the screaming voices in my head telling me that I don&#x2019;t measure up, that I&#x2019;m inferior, that the other guy is better-looking, that this woman has a better job, that everyone knows more than I do. Serenity is the absence of self, not of constantly thinking about me, and of sometimes actually thinking about others. Stopping drinking was the first step, because drinking is only a symptom of my disease. My fundamental problem is my lack of acceptance of the world as it is, as opposed to the way I demand it to be.<br> <br>A person I really respect in recovery once said to me, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where I got this idea of having a pain-free life. My parents didn&#x2019;t tell me&#x2014;not that I listened to anything they said anyway&#x2014;nor did my friends, teachers, doctor, rabbi, or bosses. Somehow I grew up thinking that I shouldn&#x2019;t have to experience pain. If I felt any pain at all, anything that bothered me, I drank or smoked it away. I mean, that&#x2019;s the smart thing to do, right? The problem was that when I stopped drinking and drugging, I was a fourteen-year-old boy trapped in a twenty-five-year-old man&#x2019;s body because I never matured. I never learned how to deal with the normal disappointments, heartaches, and difficulties of life. The second the going got tough, I got going to the liquor store.&#x201d;<br> <br>In the course of this book, you&#x2019;ll see that my mother&#x2019;s approach and my approach to sobriety are a little different. She hit the bottom and went to an outpatient rehabilitation center the day before Christmas 1990 and was a fan of that program for many years. Though she doesn&#x2019;t go to twelve-step meetings, she has come to grips with her alcoholism. We&#x2019;d agree that anything that gets you to stop drinking and using is the right approach: organized religion, twelve-step meetings, living in a cabin in the woods, being an exercise fanatic. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. The one thing I kept telling myself as I was destroying my life with beer and pot was that they were all I had left. It&#x2019;s the supreme irony of addictions that what is killing you masquerades as the answer.<br> <br>There is a theory in recovery that you stop maturing after you begin drinking excessively, and that was certainly my case. Getting sober at twenty-five was more than lucky; it was a power greater than I, working in my life.<br> <br>Think getting sober is easier at twenty-five than forty-five?<br> <br>As a friend of mine in recovery said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not easy being young in recovery.&#x201d; Those of us in our twenties were a minority (albeit fast-growing). Plus, I hadn&#x2019;t done anything in my life to help define me, to give me an identity. No wife, no kids, no career. Nothing.<br> <br>And the lies the disease tells you! I remember as a child watching the TV adaptation of Sybil with a (very young) Sally Field and wondering what it would be like to have a split personality. There&#x2019;s a reason why Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is popular: because alcoholism is beyond the yin-yang polarity of good and evil in all of us. From a nice teenage boy I turned into a monster, in a fury at the world for not being the way I wanted it to be. I was going to show them all, and if I couldn&#x2019;t show them, I was going to kill myself.<br> <br>When I was new in recovery, I completely ignored the slogan &#x201c;One Day at a Time&#x201d; (which I&#x2019;ve come to believe is the single most important message I&#x2019;ve learned in my sobriety) because I could simply not imagine not drinking or getting high again.<br> <br>Here are some of my early questions that proved to me I couldn&#x2019;t stop drinking:<br> <br>&#x201c;What about a business meeting when the client has a glass of wine? Won&#x2019;t I appear to be insulting him if I don&#x2019;t have one, too?&#x201d;<br> <br>I discovered later that the only people who care if I don&#x2019;t drink are those with drinking problems themselves. No one cares whether you drink as long as they get to drink themselves.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about dating? What if the girl I&#x2019;m dating has a drink? Won&#x2019;t she think I&#x2019;m a loser if I don&#x2019;t drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>Actually, no. If a girl is turned off by your nondrinking, you shouldn&#x2019;t be dating her. Before I got sober, I had to lie about the volume of my alcohol intake. I used my girlfriends as a control mechanism on my addiction, as monitors, and that&#x2019;s not a job anyone wants. After I got sober, I followed a very strict rule about dating. On the first date, after the normal chitchat and getting-to-know-you part, I would tell her at dinner I didn&#x2019;t drink and was sober X number of years. I was being fair to them, but more important, I wouldn&#x2019;t be tempted to keep it hidden and then want to drink that glass of red wine that was so large, you could wash a Buick in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;What, can&#x2019;t I have a drink on my wedding day?&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t have a girlfriend. I was convinced the FBI was outside my door, and auditory hallucinations at work were beginning to be a distraction. I wasn&#x2019;t getting married anytime soon.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can I go to a football game without getting high?&#x201d;<br> <br>When I told my therapist that I had been stopped by the police in Washington Square Park for attempting to buy marijuana (I was let go without being charged, thank God for the non-Giuliani years in New York City), he asked why I had done something so stupid. &#x201c;Because my regular guy was out, and I was going to go to the Giants&#x2013;Eagles game, and I had to have some weed.&#x201d; When he asked why I had to get high to watch a football game, I had no answer except: &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of going to a football game if you aren&#x2019;t stoned?&#x201d;<br> <br>I got married thirteen years ago and didn&#x2019;t have to drink.

Featuring nineteen vignettes rich in personal characterizations and theoretical analysis, Sloterdijk's companionable volume casts the development of philosophical thinking not as a buildup of compelling books and arguments but as a lifelong, intimate struggle with intellectual and spiritual movements, filled with as many pitfalls and derailments as transcendent breakthroughs.<br><br>Sloterdijk delves into the work and times of Aristotle, Augustine, Bruno, Descartes, Foucault, Fichte, Hegel, Husserl, Kant, Kierkegaard, Leibniz, Marx, Nietzsche, Pascal, Plato, Sartre, Schelling, Schopenhauer, and Wittgenstein. He provocatively juxtaposes Plato against shamanism and Marx against Gnosticism, revealing both the vital external influences shaping these intellectuals' thought and the excitement and wonder generated by the application of their thinking in the real world. The philosophical "temperament" as conceived by Sloterdijk represents the uniquely creative encounter between the mind and a diverse array of cultures. It marks these philosophers' singular achievements and the special dynamic at play in philosophy as a whole. Creston Davis's introduction details Sloterdijk's own temperament, surveying the celebrated thinker's intellectual context, rhetorical style, and philosophical persona.</p><p><p>A new perspective on nineteen great philosophers--as well as the practice of philosophy itself.</p>Peter Sloterdijk is professor of aesthetics and philosophy at the Institute of Design in Karlsruhe and teaches at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.

On board the HMS Defender he soon learns that a sailor's life is full of hard, boring, sometimes dangerous work. The Defender, a midsize ship, has been on blockade duty along the French coast, plagued by the guns at Dumont. When some of the ship's crew go ashore to capture the battery, they are betrayed and only Jack is small enough to escape through the bars and warn the ship&#x2014;just in time to fight with a much larger French ship. The book provides explanatory notes on each page; it also includes a bibliography and suggests further reading such as C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series. Weigel's old-fashioned comics art shows lots of authentic details of eighteenth-century shipboard life, and there is some battle violence, including images of characters being shot.

Visit her at juliekagawa.com.</p><br><br>I smelled blood as soon as I walked into the room.<br><br>A blast of snow-laced air accompanied me, swirling around my black coat, clinging to my hair and clothes as I shoved back the door. The space beyond was small and dirty, with rotting tables scattered about the f loor and steel drums set at every corner, thick smoke pouring from the mouths to hover near the roof. An ancient ceiling fan, half its blades broken or missing, spun limply, doing little to disperse the choking air.<br><br>Every eye in the room turned as I stepped through the frame and, once settled on me, didn't glance away. Hard, dangerous, broken faces watched intently as I passed their tables, like feral dogs scenting blood. I ignored them, moving steadily across the creaky floorboards, feeling nails and chips of glass under my boots. I didn't need to take a breath to know the air reeked of sweat and alcohol and human filth.<br><br>And blood. The scent of it clung to the walls and floors, soaked into the rotting tables, smeared in dark stains across the wood. It flowed through the veins of every human here, hot and heady. I heard several heartbeats quicken as I made my way to the counter, felt the eager stirrings of lust and hunger, but also the hint of fear, unease. Some of them, at least, were sober enough to guess the truth.<br><br>The man behind the counter was a grizzled giant with a snarl of scar tissue across his throat. It crept up his neck and twisted the left corner of his lip into a permanent scowl. He eyed me without expression as I took a seat on one of the moldy bar stools, resting my arms on the badly dinged counter. His gaze flicked to the hilt of the sword strapped to my back, and one of his eyelids twitched.<br><br>"I'm afraid I don't have the type of drink you're looking for," he said in a low voice, as his hands slid under the bar. When they came up again, I knew they wouldn't be empty. <em>Shotgun, probably,</em> I guessed. <em>Or maybe a baseball bat.</em> "Not on tap, anyway."<br><br>I smiled without looking up. "You know what I am."<br><br>"Wasn't difficult. Pretty girl walking into a place like this either has a death wish or is already dead." He snorted, shooting a dark look at the patrons behind us. I could feel their hooded gazes even now. "I know what you want, and I'm not about to stop you. No one here will miss these idiots. You take what you have to, but don't trash my bar, understand?"<br><br>"Actually, I'm just looking for someone," I said, knowing I didn't have a lot of time. The dogs at my back were already stirring. "Someone like me. Bald. Tall. Face scarred all to hell." I finally looked up, meeting his impassive gaze. "Anyone like that come through here?"<br><br>A muscle worked in his jaw. Beneath his grimy shirt, his heartbeat picked up, and a sheen of sweat appeared on his brow. For a moment, he seemed torn about whether he should pull out the gun or whatever he had beneath the counter. I kept my expression neutral, unthreatening, my hands on the bar between us.<br><br>"You've seen him," I prodded carefully. He shook himself, then turned that blank stare on me.<br><br>"No." The reply seemed dragged from somewhere deep within. "Ididn't see him. But..." He glanced at the men behind me, as if judging how much time we had, before shaking his head. "About a month ago, a stranger came through. No one saw him enter, and no one saw him leave. But we found what he left behind."<br><br>"Left behind?"<br><br>"Rickson and his boys. In their home. From one end of it to the other. They said the bodies were so scattered they never found all the pieces."<br><br>I bit the inside of my lip. "Did anyone see who did it?"<br><br>"Rickson's woman. She lived. At least, until she blew her brains out three days later. But she said the killer was a tall, pale man with a face scarred like the devil himself."<br><br>"Anyone with him?"<br><br>The barkeep frowned then shook his head. "No, she said he was alone. But he carried a large black bag with him, like a body bag. That's all we could get out of her, anyway. She wasn't terribly coherent, if you know what I mean."<br><br>I nodded, drawing back, though the words <em>body bag</em> sent a chill through my stomach. <em>I'm getting closer, though.</em> "Thank you," I murmured, sliding off the stool. "I'll be going now."<br><br>That's when I felt the arm on my shoulder.<br><br>"Oh, you're not leaving yet, little girl," murmured a voice in my ear, hot and rancid. A large hand reached down and gripped my wrist, hard enough to bruise, if I could still bruise. "It's too cold outside. Come over here and keep us warm."<br><br>A smile tugged at one corner of my mouth. <em>Finally. Took you long enough.</em><br><br>I looked at the barkeep. He met my gaze, then very deliberately turned and walked toward the back room. The man next to me didn't seem to notice; his arm slid down my back and curled around my waist, trying to drag me away. I didn't budge an inch, and he frowned, too drunk to realize what was happening.<br><br>I waited until the barkeep vanished through the door, letting it swing shut behind him, before I turned to my assailant.<br><br>He leered at me, the stench of alcohol coming off him in waves. "That's right, little girl. You want some of this, don'cha?" Behind us, a few more patrons were starting to get up; either they wanted in on the fun, or they thought they could take me out together. The rest watched behind their tankards, tense and wary, smelling of fear.<br><br>"Come on then, bitch," the man beside me said, and grabbed my other arm, his face mean and eager. "Let's do this. I can go all night."<br><br>I smiled. "Can you now?" I said quietly.<br><br>And lunged at him with a roar, sinking my fangs into his throat.<br><br>When the barkeep returned, I was already gone. He would find the bodies&#x2014;the ones stupid enough to stay and fight&#x2014;lying where they had fallen, a couple in pieces, but most of them still alive. I had what I'd come for. The Hunger had been sated, and better here, in this outpost full of bandits and murderers, than anywhere else. Better these kinds of men than an innocent family or an old couple huddled together in the ruins of an isolated cabin, trying to keep warm. I was a monster who killed and preyed on human life; I could never escape that, but at least I could choose what kind of lives I took.<br><br>Outside, the snow was falling again. Thick flakes clung to my eyelashes and cheeks and stuck to my straight black hair, but I didn't feel them. The bitter chill couldn't touch someone who was already dead.<br><br>I gave my katana a flick, causing a line of crimson to spatter to the ground. Sliding it into the sheath on my back, I started walking, my boots crunching over frozen mud. Around me, the wood and tin shanties were silent, dark smoke leaking from windows and chimney stacks. No one was out tonight; the humans were all inside, huddled around steel drums and bottles, keeping fire and alcohol between them and the icy cold. No one would see the lone teenage girl in the long black coat, walking down the path between shanties. Just like the town's other visitor, I'd come, taken what I needed and vanished back into the night. Leaving carnage behind me.<br><br>About a hundred yards away, a wall of corrugated steel and wire rose into the air, dark and bristling. It was uneven in places, with gaps and holes that had been patched and re-patched and finally forgotten about. A flimsy barrier against the creatures that lurked outside the wall. If things continued here with no change, this little outpost would eventually vanish off the face of the earth.<br><br>Not my problem.<br><br>I leaped to the roof of a shanty leaning against the wall, then over the wall itself, landing lightly on the other side. Straightening, I gazed down the rocky slope to the road that had led me here, now invisible beneath the snow. Even my footsteps, coming in from the east, had vanished beneath the layer of white.<br><br><em>He was here,</em> I thought as the wind whipped my face, tugging at my hair and coat. <em>Barely a month ago. I'm getting closer. I'm closing the gap.</em><br><br>Dropping from the cliff, I fell the twenty feet, coat flapping behind me, and landed at the edge of the road, grunting as my body absorbed the shock. Stepping onto the rough, uneven pavement, feeling it crumble under my boots, I walked to where the road split, weaving off in two directions. One path curved away, circling the tiny outpost before heading south; the other continued east, toward the soon-to-be-rising sun.<br><br>I gazed down one direction, then the other, waiting. And just like at the last crossroads I'd hit, it was there again. That faint pull, telling me to continue northeast. It was more than a hunch, more than a gut instinct. Though I couldn't explain it completely, I knew which direction would lead me to my sire. <em>Blood calls to blood.</em> The killings I'd found on my travels, like the unfortunate family in the settlement behind me, only confirmed it. He was traveling fast, but I was catching up, slowly but surely. He couldn't hide from me forever.<br><br><em>I'm still coming, Kanin.</em><br><br>Dawn was a couple hours away. I could cover a lot of ground before then, so I started off once more, heading down the road toward an unknown destination. Chasing a shadow.<br><br>Knowing we were running out of time.<br>I walked through the night, the wind icy in my face, unable to numb my already cold skin. The road stretched on, silent and empty. Nothing moved in the darkness. I passed the tangled remains of old neighborhoods, streets vacant and overgrown, buildings crumbling under the weight of the snow and time. Since the plague that wiped out most of humanity and the rabid outbreak soon after, most cities had been reduced to empty husks. I'd found a few settlements scattered here and there, humans living free despite the constant threat of rabids or invasion from their own kind. But the majority of the population existed in the vampire cities, the great, walled-in territories where the coven provided food and "safety" in exchange for blood and freedom. The humans in the vampire cities were nothing more than cattle, really, but that was the price of vampire protection. Or, that's what they wanted you to believe. Monsters existed on both sides of the wall, but at least the rabids were honest about wanting to eat you. In a vampire city, you were really just living on borrowed time, until the killers who smiled and patted you on the head finally showed their true colors.<br><br>I should know. I was born there.<br><br>The road stretched on, and I followed as it snaked through white forests grown up around sprawling towns and suburbs, until the sky turned charcoal-gray and sluggishness began to drag me under. Heading off the road, I found a faded ranch house choked with weeds and brambles. They grew up through the porch and coiled around the roof, smothering the walls, but the house itself seemed fairly intact. I eased my way up the steps and kicked open the door, ducking inside.<br><br>Small furry creatures scurried into the shadows, and a cloud of snow rose from my entry, swirling across the floor. I spared a glance at the simple furniture, covered in dust and cobwebs, strangely undisturbed.<br><br>On the wall closest to me sat an old yellow sofa, one side chewed by rodents, spilling dirty fluff over the floor. Memory stirred, a scene of another time, another house like this one, empty and abandoned.<br><br>For just a moment, I saw <em>him</em> there, slumped against the cushions with his elbows on his knees, pale hair glimmering in the darkness. I remembered the warmth of his hands on my skin, those piercing blue eyes as they gazed at me, trying to figure me out, the tightness in my chest when I'd had to turn away, to leave him behind.<br><br>Frowning, I collapsed to the sofa myself and ran a hand over my eyes, dissolving the memory and the last of the frost clinging to my lashes. I couldn't think of him now. He was in Eden with the others. He was safe. Kanin was not.<br><br>I leaned back, resting my head on the back of the couch. Kanin. My sire, the vampire who'd Turned me, who'd saved my life and taught me everything I knew&#x2014;he was the one I had to focus on now.<br><br>Just thinking of my maker caused a frown to crease my forehead. I owed the vampire my life, and it was a debt I was determined to repay, though I could never understand him. Kanin had been a mystery from the very start, from that fateful night in the rain when I'd been attacked by rabids outside my city's walls. I'd been dying, and a stranger had appeared out of nowhere, offering to save me, presenting me with the choice. Die...or become a monster.<br><br>Obviously, I'd chosen to live. But even after I'd made my decision, Kanin hadn't left. He'd stayed, teaching me what it meant to be a vampire, making sure I knew exactly what I had chosen. I probably wouldn't have survived those first few weeks without him.<br><br>But Kanin had secrets of his own, and one night the darkest of them caught up to us in the form of Sarren, a twisted vampire with a vendetta. Dangerous, cunning and completely out of his mind, Sarren had tracked us to the hidden lab we were using as a hideout, and we were forced to flee. In the chaos that had followed, Kanin and I were separated, and my mentor had vanished back into the unknown from where he'd come. I hadn't seen him since.<br><br>But then the dreams began.<br><br>I rose, the cushions squeaking beneath me, and wandered down a musty hallway to the room at the end. It had been a bedroom at one point, and the twin bed in the corner was far enough away from the window to be out of the sun if it came creeping into the room.<br><br>Just to be safe, I hung a ratty blanket over the sill, covering the pane and plunging the room into shadow. Outside, it was still snowing, tiny flakes drifting from a dark, cloudy sky, but I wasn't taking any chances should it clear up. Lying back on the bed, keeping my sword close, I stared at the ceiling and waited for sleep to claim me.<br><br>Vampires don't dream. Technically, we are dead, our sleep that of a corpse, black and depthless. My "dreams" were of Kanin, in trouble. Seeing through his eyes and feeling what he felt. Because in times of extreme duress, pain or emotion, blood called to blood, and I could sense what my sire was feeling. Agony. Sarren had found him. And was taking his revenge.<br><br>My eyes narrowed as I recalled the very last one.<br><br></p><h2>AlterKnits Felt: Imaginative Projects for Knitting &amp; Felting</h2><p>There&#x2019;s something magical about felting knits: You start with a piece of fabric that looks and feels a certain way and, by exposing it to water and agitation, finish with one that looks and feels completely different. This fascinating transformation is what led author Leigh Radford to begin felting years ago, and has kept her intrigued by the process ever since.<p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>Now, in <i>AlterKnits Felt</i>, Radford pushes the boundaries of traditional felting, as she did with traditional knitting in her earlier book, <i>AlterKnits</i>. Through 30 colorful, vibrant projects, she shows readers how to knit and then felt their own handiwork, as well as how to create gorgeous felted objects from recycled knits and unspun fiber. An introductory chapter on felting basics explains everything you need to know to make the fabulous clothes, accessories, and home decor that follow. <p></p>&nbsp;<p></p>The projects range from a quick and easy circle coin purse, to a shibori bag, to a reverse-appliqu� rug, each unusual in its own way, distinguished by a special surface texture, an innovative mix of techniques, or a quirky combination of yarns. <i>AlterKnits Felt</i> provides every crafter with the tools to explore&#x2015;and expand&#x2015;the art of felting. <p></p><br></p><p>Leigh Radford is the author of <i>AlterKnits</i> (STC) and <i>One Skein</i> (Interweave), a highly sought-after teacher, and the former art director of <i>Interweave Knits</i> magazine.

Their influence and expeditions extended from Newfoundland to Baghdad, their battles were as far-flung as Africa and the Arctic. But were they great seafarers or desperate outcasts, noble heathens or oafish pirates, the last pagans or the first of the modern Europeans? This concise study puts medieval chronicles, Norse sagas and Muslim accounts alongside more recent research into ritual magic, genetic profiling and climatology. It includes biographical sketches of some of the most famous Vikings, from Erik Bloodaxe to Saint Olaf, and King Canute to Leif the Lucky. It explains why the Danish king Harald Bluetooth lent his name to a twenty-first century wireless technology; which future saint laughed as she buried foreign ambassadors alive; why so many Icelandic settlers had Irish names; and how the last Viking colony was destroyed by English raiders.

He explains how to identify your hair type and how to select shampoos and conditioners to match it; how to avoid the dangers inherent in potentially damaging processes, such as dying, permanent waving, coloring, bleaching, and the use of brushes, curlers, and pins.

His candid memoirs offer a unique eyewitness account of events leading up to and during the war, culminating in those dark final days in the F�hrer's headquarters, deep under the shattered city of Berlin.<br><br>He begins by describing his duties as a member of Hitler&#x2019;s personal staff in the years preceding the war, driving the F�hrer throughout Germany and abroad, and accompanying him to rallies. The crux of his memoirs however covers his life with Hitler in the Berlin F�hrerbunker. During this time he was responsible for a transport fleet of cars, and often drove the likes of Speer or Kesselring on inspection tours to the hot spots on the front; and in March 1945, he accompanied the F�hrer to his final front-inspection tour. Kempka was also present when news came through of G�ring and Himmler&#x2019;s efforts to seize power and negotiate a truce with the Western Allies.<br><br>Crucially, Kempka also witnessed Hitler&#x2019;s marriage to Eva Braun, and his last dinner and personal farewell to all those present, before he and his wife committed suicide. Hitler&#x2019;s final order to Kempka was that he have ready enough petrol to burn him and his wife. Under constant Soviet artillery fire, Kempke, Linge and others poured petrol over the bodies and burnt them.<br><br>The account concludes with Kempka&#x2019;s hazardous escape out of a burning Berlin more than 800 km through enemy-occupied Germany, home to find his wife at BE.

But in <i>Shaq Talks Back</i>, Shaquille O'Neal for the first time talks frankly about his childhood, his life, his rivalries, and his career, culminating in a dramatic, behind-the-scenes account of the Los Angeles Lakers' drive to the NBA Championship.<br><br>At seven feet one inch tall and 330 pounds, Shaq has always faced outsized expectations, even as a child when he towered over other kids. <i>Shaq Talks Back</i> is the story of how potential became reality-- how someone expected to be a champion finally learned to become one. Beginning with his memory of crying on the court after the Lakers defeated the Indiana Pacers, Shaq takes us back to his younger days in Newark and Jersey City, New Jersey, then to Georgia and finally to Germany, where he began to harness some of his height and strength.<br><br>From there, he recounts the remarkable progress of his basketball career, changing from a big but inexperienced teenager to a dominant college and professional player. Shaq talks about:<br><br>* Playing at Louisiana State University for the unpredictable coach Dale Brown<br>* Signing the biggest rookie contract ever with the Orlando Magic-- and going to the NBA Finals for the first time<br>* What happened next: dissention, disappointment, and his decision to leave for Los Angeles<br>* The dysfunctional Lakers who were never able to win the big games<br>* Dealing with egos as he finds the right chemistry with Kobe Bryant, Phil Jackson, and new additions to the team<br>* Rivalries with Alonzo Mourning, Patrick Ewing, Hakeem Olajuwon, David Robinson, and others<br>* The trouble with free throws...<br>* "Bling-bling" and women: the larger-than-life world of NBA players off the court<br>* Inside the Lakers' comeback from the brink against Portland and the drive to the NBA championship<br><br>Funny, insightful, opinionated, and unexpectedly moving, <i>Shaq Talks Back</i> is the true voice of the NBA's best player.<br></p><p>Shaquille O'Neal lives in Los Angeles. He is the center for the World Champion Los Angeles Lakers and was chosen as the Most Valuable Player in the NBA for the 1999-2000 season.<br>Shaquille O'Neal, all seven-feet-something, 330 pounds of him, is the dominant player in the NBA today, the man in the middle on the world-champion Los Angeles Lakers. His words draw a crowd because he's a marquee star, but the question, as it always is with sports autobiographies, is whether he has anything to say. The answer is not much. The story of his loving but sometimes harshly disciplined childhood with his mom and military stepfather does provide an explanation as to why, despite a few on-court controversies, Shaq has managed to handle his fame with dignity and humor. Both of those qualities are present here as he recounts his college years, his entry into the NBA after his sophomore season, and the early years in Orlando that included a promising a trip to the NBA finals but ended with acrimony. Now that he's 30 and owns a championship ring, he feels free to talk about fellow players, coaches, and media. A petulant side emerges here (the talking-back part); clearly, Shaq holds a grudge, even against Lenny Wilkens (the all-time winningest NBA coach) who only played Shaq for 43 seconds in the Olympic gold medal game. He's also hard on television commentator Pete Vescey ("That crazy cat will write anything"). In the end, NBA fans, who form the built-in audience for this book, will find it more substantive than they might have expected but without any significant revelations. On balance: a nice enough, very rich young man tells his story with as much panache as he can muster. <i>Wes Lukowsky</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It could hardly be less if the guidelines in this handsome and intelligent book are followed. His philosophy is simple: employ the principles of good design, buy the best you can afford (but never anything you don't need or like) and never let fashion dominate function. Murrell's advice will prove helpful in designing kitchens of various sizes, utility rooms or any space where storage is a consideration. German and Italian influences are drawn upon, and, surprisingly, the inspiration for the small kitchen is the busy, spacious kitchen of the 19th century. Murrell convincingly argues that a tall, shallow pantry cupboard, work surfaces accessible to several people at once and separated cooking areas (the combination range-oven is out of favor) make the best use of limited space. The neat, short sections on refrigeration, shelves and cabinets, ventilation, small equipment, etc. and the photographs of beautiful kitchens make the book a pleasure to use as well as a valuable reference. A list of suppliers is included. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>3 Steps to Incredible Health (Learn it!

Sherriff&#39;s Journey&#39;s End is an unflinching vision of life in the trenches towards the end of the First World War, published in Penguin Classics. Set in the First World War, Journey&#39;s End concerns a group of British officers on the front line and opens in a dugout in the trenches in France. Raleigh, a new eighteen-year-old officer fresh out of English public school, joins the besieged company of his friend and cricketing hero Stanhope, and finds him dramatically changed. Laurence Olivier starred as Stanhope in the first performance of Journey&#39;s End in 1928; the play was an instant stage success and remains a remarkable anti-war classic. R.C. Sherriff (1896-1975) joined the army shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, serving as a captain in the East Surrey regiment. After the war, an interest in amateur theatricals led him to try his hand at writing. Following rejection by many theatre managements, Journey&#39;s End was given a single performance by the Incorporated Stage Society, in which Lawrence Olivier took the lead role. The play&#39;s enormous success enabled Sherriff to become a full-time writer, with plays such as Badger&#39;s Green (1930), St Helena (1935), and The Long Sunset (1955); though he is also remembered as a screenplay writer, for films such as The Invisible Man (1933), Goodbye Mr Chips (1933) and The Dam Busters (1955). If you enjoyed Journey&#39;s End, you might like Robert Graves&#39;s Goodbye to All That, available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;Its unrelenting tension, and its regard for human decency in a vast world of human waste, are impressive and, even now, moving&#39; Clive Barnes</p><p>R.C.

From an exploration of an abandoned mine in England to an Antarctic sea voyage to South Georgia's old whaling stations, from a sojourn in South America to a stay among an Inuit community in Canada, she uncovers species, cultures, and industries touched by extinction. Accompanying her on this journey are the thoughts of anthropologists, biologists, and philosophers who have come before her. Drawing on their words as well as firsthand witness and ancestral memory, Challenger traces the mindset that led to our destructiveness and proposes a path of redemption rooted in our emotional responses. This sobering yet illuminating book looks beyond natural devastation to examine why&#x201d; and what's next.&#x201d;</p><p>Melanie Challenger is a freelance writer.

It is deceptive, simple, and as common as water: anything is possible. This second collection by Steve Scafidi is haunted by the possible and "the bells of the verb to be" that "ring-a-ding-ding calling us / to the holy dark of this first / warm night of Spring." When anything is possible, Scafidi finds, horror is as likely as delight. In poems both meditative and defiant he mourns the eventual loss of all that we love and finds consolation, wherever possible, in the rhythm of common words and "the sacred guesswork" of the imagination. Here is the dangerous world we all have in common. Here is a brief and hopeful book.Steve Scafidi is the author of the poetry collection Sparks from a Nine-Pound Hammer, winner of the Larry Levis Reading Prize. His poem "The Egg Suckers" received the 2005 James Boatwright Prize from Shenandoah literary magazine. He is a cabinetmaker and lives with his family in Summit Point, West Virginia."Steve Scafidi's poem 'The Egg Suckers' made me laugh, fidget, and ponder my own path through this omnivorous world. It reminds us that things are constantly happening beneath our very feet, that a secret history is being forged that we'll never read about in the newspapers. Like Theodore Roethke, Scafidi describes a nature that is at least as nasty as it is nice and then lets us know that -- oops! -- we're on the menu, too. Re-reading 'The Egg Suckers,' I laughed again. And then I made breakfast." -- David Kirby</p></p><p><p>Steve Scafidi is the author of the poetry collection Sparks from a Nine-Pound Hammer, winner of the Larry Levis Reading Prize.

These poems demonstrate one poet's great and essential urgency to create beauty out of the raw materials of existence. Scafidi is a 'maker' in two ways. he is not only a cabinetmaker who writes poems, but is also a poet who labors with his hands. this rare combination of the physical and spiritual yields a poetry that is as energetic as it is high-minded.

Now, in <i>Blink</i>, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within.<br><i>Blink</i> is a book about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant--in the blink of an eye--that actually aren't as simple as they seem. Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error? How do our brains really work--in the office, in the classroom, in the kitchen, and in the bedroom? And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<br>In <i>Blink</i> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of "blink": the election of Warren Harding; "New Coke"; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police.<br><i>Blink</i> reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of "thin-slicing"--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.</p><p><i>Blink</i> is about the first two seconds of looking--the decisive glance that knows in an instant. Gladwell, the best-selling author of <i>The Tipping Point</i>, campaigns for snap judgments and mind reading with a gift for translating research into splendid storytelling. Building his case with scenes from a marriage, heart attack triage, speed dating, choking on the golf course, selling cars, and military maneuvers, he persuades readers to think small and focus on the meaning of "thin slices" of behavior. The key is to rely on our "adaptive unconscious"--a 24/7 mental valet--that provides us with instant and sophisticated information to warn of danger, read a stranger, or react to a new idea. <p> Gladwell includes caveats about leaping to conclusions: marketers can manipulate our first impressions, high arousal moments make us "mind blind," focusing on the wrong cue leaves us vulnerable to "the Warren Harding Effect" (i.e., voting for a handsome but hapless president). In a provocative chapter that exposes the "dark side of blink," he illuminates the failure of rapid cognition in the tragic stakeout and murder of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. He underlines studies about autism, facial reading and cardio uptick to urge training that enhances high-stakes decision-making. In this brilliant, cage-rattling book, one can only wish for a thicker slice of Gladwell's ideas about what Blink Camp might look like. <i>--Barbara Mackoff</i></p>Malcolm Gladwell is the author of five <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers: <i>The Tipping Point,</i> <i>Blink, Outliers,</i> <i>What the Dog Saw,</i> and <i>David and Goliath.</i> He is also the co-founder of Pushkin Industries, an audio content company that produces the podcasts <i>Revisionist History</i>, which reconsiders things both overlooked and misunderstood, and <i>Broken Record, </i>where he, Rick Rubin, and Bruce Headlam interview musicians across a wide range of genres. Gladwell has been included in the <i>Time</i> 100 Most Influential People list and touted as one of <i>Foreign Policy</i>'s<i> </i>Top Global Thinkers.</p><h2>Usagi Yojimbo Volume 23: Bridge Of Tears</h2><p>The wandering life of a ronin is often a lonely one, and Usagi has been on that path a long time. A temporary peace, staying with the merchant Endo and his daughter Hanaka, is interrupted by the deadly League of Assassins, setting Usagi back on the road, but with the uncomfortable sensation that he is being followed. Usagi&#39;s travels next take him to a town torn apart by street gangs searching for a dead gang boss&#39;s stash of gold. While in town, Usagi meets Mayumi, who longs for a new life away from the village and convinces Usagi to take her with him. As attraction grows between them, Usagi faces a dilemma: can another join him on his path, or is the lifestyle of a ronin too dangerous for Mayumi, especially as signs point to the return of Jei, the Black Soul?</p><p></p><h2>Ritual Use of Magical Tools: Resources for the Ceremonial Magician</h2><p>If you've ever looked at books about the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, you know they used all sorts of wands, paraphernalia and tools.

It also has much to teach us about the wilderness within and the divine presence that is manifest in nature. In this, his last work, beloved author Gerald May offers a memoir and spiritual guide that reveals the great lessons available to us when we retreat from our busy lives to the serenity of the natural wilderness.</p><p><em>The Wisdom of Wilderness</em> expresses the healing and wholeness May received through spending time in the wild -- whether hiking, camping, canoeing, fishing, or, often, just sitting. Also, May saw that wilderness can be found anywhere -- a garden, a park, perhaps in one's own room, or even in other people. Wherever we find it, it calls to what is natural in each of our hearts, reassuring us that we are part of a bigger creation and teaching us how to make peace with the outer world and with our inner selves.</p><p>For May, nature was not something to rise above. The belief that we must dominate and tame all that is wild around and within us is the most fundamental estrangement of Western civilization, long inflicting wounds upon the planet and upon ourselves. But before we can effectively heal the earth, we must somehow recover our own natural wholeness, our own wildness and kinship with nature. We cannot do this healing for ourselves, but only through "the grace of Something or Someone beyond" -- and in May's case, he found this grace in Nature itself.</p><p>This moving, beautifully written book is Gerald May at his best. It includes a foreword by author Parker J. Palmer, which illuminates the importance of May's life and writing and explains how this last book fits into the body of his work. </p></p><p><p>Gerald G. May, M.D. (1940-2005), practiced medicine and psychiatry for twenty-five years before becoming a senior fellow in contemplative theology and psychology at the Shalem Institute for Spiritual Formation in Bethesda, Maryland. He was the author of many books and articles blending spirituality and psychology, including <em>Addiction and Grace</em>, <em>Care of Mind/Care of Spirit</em>, <em>Will and Spirit</em>, and <em>The Dark Night of the Soul</em>.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Psychiatrist May (1940&#x2013;2005), known for his works blending psychology and spirituality (<i>Addiction and Grace</i>), chose the theme and milieu of Nature for this, his last book. Chronicling outdoor forays he took from 1990 to 1995, May's elegant prose uses a storyteller's magic to plumb the profound mystery of outside events that provoke and foster inner change. Vivid details and masterful style place the reader in context: breathing alongside a bear, drumming with cicadas, grieving a man-mutilated turtle, dodging eagles or seeking fire's heat in a soaking storm. "Thunder came and it was my song, and the wind my courtesan, and praise welled up inside me as the rain poured, drenching down around and in and through me until the fire finally died under its flow and there was nothing but cold dark chilling water covering everything, running down my legs into rivulets." May is a kind of Christian Zen master, but this book doesn't favor a particular religious tradition so much as the deep wild of nature's way. In this work for everyone, he wants us to understand that wilderness is our natural state and that contemplative communion with the "Power of the Slowing" will bring us safely home to our wild eternal selves. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Each side demands that you not only disagree with but disdain the other as (at best) crazy or (at worst) evil. This is particularly true when religion is the point at issue. Progressives cry out that fundamentalism is growing rapidly and nonbelief is stigmatized. They point out that politics has turned toward the right, supported by mega-churches and mobilized orthodox believers. Conservatives endlessly denounce what they see as an increasingly skeptical and relativistic society. Major universities, media companies, and elite institutions are heavily secular, they say, and they control the culture.</p><p>Which is it? Is skepticism or faith on the ascendancy in the world today? The answer is Yes. The enemies are both right. Skepticism, fear, and anger toward traditional religion are growing in power and influence. But at the same time, robust, orthodox belief in the traditional faiths is growing as well.</p><p>The non-churchgoing population in the United States and Europe is steadily increasing.1 The number of Americans answering &#x201c;no religious preference&#x201d; to poll questions has skyrocketed, having doubled or even tripled in the last decade.2 A century ago most U.S. universities shifted from a formally Christian foundation to an overtly secular one.3 As a result, those with traditional religious beliefs have little foothold in any of the institutions of cultural power. But even as more and more people identify themselves as having &#x201c;no religious preference,&#x201d; certain churches with supposedly obsolete beliefs in an infallible Bible and miracles are growing in the United States and exploding in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Even in much of Europe, there is some growth in church attendance.4 And despite the secularism of most universities and colleges, religious faith is growing in some corners of academia. It is estimated that 10 to 25 percent of all the teachers and professors of philosophy in the country are orthodox Christians, up from less than 1 percent just thirty years ago.5 Prominent academic Stanley Fish may have had an eye on that trend when he reported, &#x201c;When Jacques Derrida died [in November 2004] I was called by a reporter who wanted to know what would succeed high theory and the triumvirate of race, gender, and class as the center of intellectual energy in the academy. I answered like a shot: religion.&#x201d;6</p><p>In short, the world is polarizing over religion. It is getting both more religious and less religious at the same time. There was once a confident belief that secular European countries were the harbingers for the rest of the world. Religion, it was thought, would thin out from its more robust, supernaturalist forms or die out altogether. But the theory that technological advancement brings inevitable secularization is now being scrapped or radically rethought.7 Even Europe may not face a secular future, with Christianity growing modestly and Islam growing exponentially.</p><p>The Two Camps</p><p>I speak from an unusual vantage point on this two-edged phenomenon. I was raised in a mainline Lutheran church in eastern Pennsylvania. When I reached my teens in the early 1960s, the time came for me to attend confirmation class, a two-year course that covered Christian beliefs, practices, and history. Its aim was to bring young people into a fuller understanding of the faith, so they could publicly commit to it. My teacher for the first year was a retired minister. He was quite traditional and conservative, speaking often of the danger of hell and the need for great faith. In the second year of the course, however, the instructor was a new, young cleric just out of seminary. He was a social activist and was filled with deep doubts about traditional Christian doctrine. It was almost like being instructed in two different religions. In the first year, we stood before a holy, just God whose wrath could only be turned aside at great effort and cost. In the second year, we heard of a spirit of love in the universe, who mainly required that we work for human rights and the liberation of the oppressed. The main question I wanted to ask our instructors was, &#x201c;Which one of you is lying?&#x201d; But fourteen-year-olds are not so bold, and I just kept my mouth shut.</p><p>My family later found its way to a more conservative church in a small Methodist denomination. For several years this strengthened what could be called the &#x201c;Hellfire Layer&#x201d; of my religious formation, although the pastor and people there were personally as gentle as could be. Then I went off to one of those fine, liberal, smaller universities in the Northeast, which quickly began to throw water on the hellfire in my imagination.</p><p>The history and philosophy departments were socially radicalized and were heavily influenced by the neo-Marxist critical theory of the Frankfurt School. In 1968, this was heady stuff. The social activism was particularly attractive, and the critique of American bourgeoisie society was compelling, but its philosophical underpinnings were confusing to me. I seemed to see two camps before me, and there was something radically wrong with both of them. The people most passionate about social justice were moral relativists, while the morally upright didn&#x2019;t seem to care about the oppression going on all over the world. I was emotionally drawn to the former path&#x2014;what young person wouldn&#x2019;t be? Liberate the oppressed and sleep with who you wanted! But I kept asking the question, &#x201c;If morality is relative, why isn&#x2019;t social justice as well?&#x201d; This seemed to be a blatant inconsistency in my professors and their followers. Yet now I saw the stark contradiction in the traditional churches. How could I turn back to the kind of orthodox Christianity that supported segregation in the South and apartheid in South Africa? Christianity began to seem very unreal to me, though I was unable to discern a viable alternative way of life and thought.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know it at the time, but this spiritual &#x201c;unreality&#x201d; stemmed from three barriers that lay across my path. During my college years, these three barriers eroded and my faith became vital and life-affecting. The first barrier was an intellectual one. I was confronted with a host of tough questions about Christianity: &#x201c;What about other religions? What about evil and suffering? How could a loving God judge and punish? Why believe anything at all?&#x201d; I began to read books and arguments on both sides of these issues and slowly but surely, Christianity began to make more and more sense. The rest of this book lays out why I still think so.</p><p>The second barrier was an interior, personal one. As a child, the plausibility of a faith can rest on the authority of others, but when we reach adulthood there is a need for personal, firsthand experience as well. While I had &#x201c;said my prayers&#x201d; for years, and while I sometimes had that inspirational, aesthetic sense of wonder at the sight of a sea or mountain, I had never experienced God&#x2019;s presence personally. This required not so much knowledge of techniques for prayer, but a process in which I came to grips with my own needs, flaws, and problems. It was painful, and was, as is typical, triggered by disappointments and failures. It would take another, different kind of book to go into them. But it needs to be said that faith-journeys are never simply intellectual exercises.</p><p>The third barrier was a social one. I desperately needed to find a &#x201c;third camp,&#x201d; a group of Christians who had a concern for justice in the world but who grounded it in the nature of God rather than in their own subjective feelings. When I found that &#x201c;band of brothers&#x201d;&#x2014;and sisters ( just as important!)&#x2014;things began to change for me. These three barriers did not come down quickly or in any set order. Rather they were intertwined and dependent on one another. I did not work through them in any methodical way. It&#x2019;s only in hindsight that I see how the three factors worked together. Because I was always looking for that third camp, I became interested in shaping and initiating new Christian communities. That meant the ministry, so I entered it just a few years after college.</p><p>The View from Manhattan</p><p>In the late 1980s, my wife, Kathy, and I moved to Manhattan with our three young sons to begin a new church for a largely non-churchgoing population. During the research phase I was told by almost everyone that it was a fool&#x2019;s errand. Church meant moderate or conservative; the city was liberal and edgy. Church meant families; New York City was filled with young singles and &#x201c;nontraditional&#x201d; households. Church most of all meant belief, but Manhattan was the land of skeptics, critics, and cynics. The middle class, the conventional market for a church, was fleeing the city because of crime and rising costs. That left the sophisticated and hip, the wealthy and the poor. Most of these people just laugh at the idea of church, I was told. Congregations in the city were dwindling, most struggling to even maintain their buildings.</p><p>Many of my early contacts said that the few congregations that had maintained a following had done so by adapting traditional Christian teaching to the more pluralistic ethos of the city. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell people they have to believe in Jesus&#x2014;that&#x2019;s considered narrow-minded here.&#x201d; They were incredulous when I explained that the beliefs of the new church would be the orthodox, historic tenets of Christianity&#x2014;the infallibility of the Bible, the deity of Christ, the necessity of spiritual regeneration (the new birth)&#x2014;all doctrines considered hopelessly dated by the majority of New Yorkers. Nobody ever said &#x201c;fuggedaboutit&#x201d; out loud, but it always hung in the air.</p><p>Nevertheless, we launched Redeemer Presbyterian Church, and by the end of 2007 it had grown to more than 5,000 attendees and had spawned more than a dozen daughter congregations in the immediate metropolitan area. The church is quite multiethnic and young (average age about thirty) and is more than two-thirds single. Meanwhile, dozens of other similarly orthodox-believing congregations have sprung up in Manhattan and hundreds of others throughout the four other boroughs. One survey showed that in the last several years more than a hundred churches had been started in New York City by Christians from Africa alone. We were as stunned by this as anyone.</p><p>New York isn&#x2019;t alone. In the fall of 2006 The Economist ran a story with the subtitle &#x201c;Christianity is collapsing everywhere but London.&#x201d; The crux of the article was that despite the fact that church attendance and profession of the Christian faith was plummeting across Britain and Europe, many young professionals (and new immigrants) in London were flocking to evangelical churches.8 That is exactly what I&#x2019;ve seen here.</p><p>This leads to a strange conclusion. We have come to a cultural moment in which both skeptics and believers feel their existence is threatened because both secular skepticism and religious faith are on the rise in significant, powerful ways. We have neither the Western Christendom of the past nor the secular, religionless society that was predicted for the future. We have something else entirely.</p><p>A Divided Culture</p><p>Three generations ago, most people inherited rather than chose their religious faith. The great majority of people belonged to one of the historic, mainline Protestant churches or the Roman Catholic Church. Today, however, the now-dubbed &#x201c;old-line&#x201d; Protestant churches of cultural, inherited faith are aging and losing members rapidly. People are opting instead for a nonreligious life, for a non-institutional, personally constructed spirituality, or for orthodox, high-commitment religious groups that expect members to have a conversion experience. Therefore the population is paradoxically growing both more religious and less religious at once.</p><p>Because doubt and belief are each on the rise, our political and public discourse on matters of faith and morality has become deadlocked and deeply divided. The culture wars are taking a toll. Emotions and rhetoric are intense, even hysterical. Those who believe in God and Christianity are out to &#x201c;impose their beliefs on the rest of us&#x201d; and &#x201c;turn back the clock&#x201d; to a less enlightened time. Those who don&#x2019;t believe are &#x201c;enemies of truth&#x201d; and &#x201c;purveyors of relativism and permissiveness.&#x201d; We don&#x2019;t reason with the other side; we only denounce.</p><p>We have an impasse between the strengthening forces of doubt and belief, and this won&#x2019;t be solved simply by calling for more civility and dialogue. Arguments depend on having commonly held reference points that both sides can hold each other to. When fundamental understandings of reality conflict, it is hard to find anything to which to appeal. The title of Alasdair MacIntyre&#x2019;s book, Whose Justice? Which Rationality? says it all. Our problems are not going away soon.</p><p>How can we find a way forward?</p><p>First, each side should accept that both religious belief and skepticism are on the rise. Atheist author Sam Harris and Religious Right leader Pat Robertson should each admit the fact that his particular tribe is strong and increasing in influence. This would eliminate the self-talk that is rampant in each camp, namely that it will soon be extinct, overrun by the opposition. Nothing like that is imminently possible. If we stopped saying such things to ourselves it might make everyone more civil and generous toward opposing views.</p><p>Such an admission is not only reassuring, but also humbling. There are still many of a secular turn of mind who confidently say orthodox faith is vainly trying to &#x201c;resist the tide of history,&#x201d; though there is no historical evidence that religion is dying out at all. Religious believers should also be much less dismissive of secular skepticism.

Reprint.</p><p><p>Gore Vidal was born Eugene Luther Vidal in 1925, later adopting the surname of his grandfather, Senator Thomas Gore, as his first name. He is the author of numerous novels&#x2014;the first, <b>Williwaw</b>, written when he was twenty-one&#x2014;as well as scripts for film, television and the stage, including the extremely successful <b>The Best Man</b> and <b>Visit to a Small Planet</b>. He is perhaps best known for his historical novels, including <b>Burr</b> (1973), 1876 (1976), and <b>Lincoln</b> (1984). He won the National Book Award in 1993 for his book of essays, <b>United States</b> (1952-1992).&nbsp;<b> </b></p><b> </b>Katz's thoughtful, scholarly book examines the words <i>heterosexual</i> and <i>homosexual</i> both of which are scarcely 100 years old--and presents heterosexuality as a historical social convention rather than as a natural, eternal given. In arguing that these categorical terms are historical and thus changeable, Katz reminds us that until very recently, sex was considered mostly functional, urgently needed for procreation in order to populate fledgling American settlements. He then scrutinizes Freud's influence as a sex theorist who changed the image of woman from her nineteenth-century idealization as the "angel in the house" to one in which lack of erotic response constituted mental illness. Moving beyond Freud, he takes us through the twentieth century, stressing the conservatism of the 1940s and 1950s before coming eventually to the churning 1990s, when a theatrical review titled <i>Heterosexuals in Crisis</i> summarizes the "general sense of a different-sex erotic emergency." Along the way, he cites such sex theorists as Kate Millett, Ti-Grace Atkinson, and Michel Foucault, weaving them into his controversial, readable discourse. <i>Whitney Scott</i></p><h2>Hitler&#39;s Generals</h2><p>Of all the groups in German life that Hitler successfully manoeuvred into supporting his personal quest for domination, the leadership of the Army was the most important. In Hitler&#39;s Generals, Correlli Barnett has gathered together an outstanding team of military historians to write about the characters and careers of twenty-six generals. Hitler&#39;s Generals probes the central mystery of why a generation of able commanders and staff officers from the most deeply professional officers in the world become subservient to Hitler&#39;s purposes and why even the best of them failed to deflect Hitler from his disastrous decisions.</p><p>Correlli Barnett is the author of many distinguished books, among them The Desert Generals, The Sword Bearers and The Collapse of British Power. Since 1977 he has been Keeper of the Churchill Archives Centre and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. From 1973 to 1985 he was also a member of Council of the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society for Literature and of the Royal Historical Society."An expertly edited compilation of biographies of the generals who brought Hitler his greates military successes ...An exhaustive portrait." --Frickensmith Review Of Books<br><br>This excellent book makes fascinating reading. Previously, I had regarded most German generals as automatons, blindly obeying the increasingly mad orders of their F�hrer to the bitter end. Having read this book I am now much better informed concerning the inner conflict suffered by most of the generals, the active if unsuccessful opposition to Hitler in which many participated, and the illnesses and breakdowns that cognitive dissonance and a relentless work ethic dealt some of them. Correlli Barnett has done an admirable job of aligning the contributions of his 17 contributors, who between them cover the lives and careers of 26 of Hitler's top generals. Along the way they provide a refreshing perspective on the German war effort and give a glimpse of the human face of even some of the vilest Nazi leaders. If some contributors are perhaps too eager to portray their subjects in a positive light, such shortcomings are frequently corrected by other contributors' passing allusions to those same subjects. In terms of its breadth, consistency and level of interest, I would rate this book even more highly than John Keegan's attempt to cover "Churchill's Generals" in a similar compilation. --S. J. Moore<br><br>Corelli Barnett effectively edits this ambitious book, which is a compilation of essays by various historians concentrating on 26 of Hitler's Generals. His skill is to divide the various personalities into groups, from the deskbound administrators like Halder, overseers like Von Runstedt to the battlefield genius of Rommel and innovation of Guderian. Time and space constraints the profile of each General, but in every case much is made of, in virtually every case, their unstinting professionalism and more tragically, their total adherence, via the unswerving loyalty demanded by the Prussian officer "code", to the aims and objectives of the Fuhrer. This provides the most interesting aspect of the book, as it details each General's attitude to Hitler, which in virtually all cases with the exception of Model, was one of distaste. Some readers may find that certain essayists excoriate their subjects more than others, but the overall feeling throughout, as mentioned above, is one of tragic paralysis, cunningly created by Hitler's requirement that all officers swear an oath of loyalty to him, and his own natural ability to divide and rule. What comes across more than anything is a detailed construct of the demands required of a large Army, and in particular, whilst no doubt horribly immoral, the remarkable achievements in the field of a professional Army that threatened to conquer the whole of Eurasia. The Wehrmacht was without doubt the most disciplined, tactically superior mechanized force the world had ever seen, and this book proves to be a fascinating insight into its prime proponents. --Toby Frith</p><h2>Fatal North: Murder Survival Aboard USS Polaris First US Expedition North Pole</h2><p>An in-depth account of the first U.S. expedition to the North Pole describes a mission that ended in the suspicious death of its leader, Charles Hall, and a desperate struggle for survival on the polar ice, drawing on original Navy inquests into the disaster, autopsy and forensic reports, personal journals, the ship&#39;s original log, and more.</p><p>Bruce Henderson is the author or coauthor of more than twenty nonfiction books, including the #1 New York Times bestseller And the Sea Will Tell, with Vincent Bugliosi, and Hero Found. An award-winning journalist and author, Bruce is a member of the Authors Guild and the American Society of Journalists and Authors.The Polaris expedition, the failed first U.S. expedition to the North Pole, is one of the strangest in the history of Arctic misadventure. It was marked by the mysterious death of its leader, Capt. Charles Francis Hall, and by bickering between different factions of the crew, both before and after their leader's death. After marooning 18 of its members, including officer George Tyson, on an ice floe (where they drifted for six months until rescued by another ship), the expedition ended when the vessel was abandoned by the remainder of the crew. In clean, fast-paced prose, Henderson (coauthor of And the Sea Will Tell) aptly conveys daily life on the ship and reconstructs its mood and politics vividly. He succeeds, too, at re-creating characters from among the crew, interspersing the thoughts of various men with dialogue, thereby immersing the reader in the story. Perhaps Henderson could have extracted more drama from the captain's death: in the final chapter, he explores in detail the possibility of foul play and the dying captain's suspicions that he was being poisoned, well after the description of the death itself. But he handles the story of the group that gets separated from the ship smoothly, having wisely focused on George Tyson, the leader of the stranded men, throughout the book. With narrative and descriptive skill, he chronicles the group's attempt to survive the Arctic winter and one another's treachery. In the end, Henderson casts significant doubt on the official inquiry into Hall's death, citing the inquiry's transcripts and drawing on the results of an autopsy performed on Hall's exhumed body in 1968 that reveal high levels of arsenic. Fans of adventure writing will appreciate this fine book. (Feb.)Forecast: Once again, two titles on the same subject will be released within shelving dates of one another; in this case, the rival, due out a week earlier, is Trial by Ice, by Richard Parry. Both are worthy books, though the Henderson is the worthier, but which the public flocks to remains to be seen.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Coffin, Scarcely Used (Flaxborough Chronicles, 1)</h2><p>This is the first book in the Flaxborough Chronicles, often considered one of the funniest of the English detective series, and introduces Inspector Purbright who looks in varius crimes in what one inhabitant calls A high-spirited town--like Gomorrah.

(c)AudioFile, Portland, Maine</p><h2>From Where You Dream: The Process of Writing Fiction</h2><p>A direct view into the mind and craft of a literary master is offered in a collection of edited transcripts of the author&#39;s thought-provoking lectures that reimagine the process of writing as emotional rather than intellectual.</p><p>Starred Review. Pulitzer-winning novelist Butler (<i>Had a Good Time</i>, etc.) teaches a creative writing class at known as "boot camp" because of the intense creative demands he places on students. This series of lectures (edited by Burroway, a graduate of the class) deftly conveys the intensity of the class as Butler exhorts students to get out of their heads and into the world of the senses ("Artists are not intellectuals. We are sensualists...."), which he posits as the seat of the emotions. Butler's emphasis on sense memories recalls Method acting, and like Stanislavsky, Butler most highly values work with deep emotional connections and rich "organic coherence" at every level. Identify your character's yearning, he says: plot "represents the dynamics of desire." Butler has little to offer anyone hoping to write the sort of commercial fiction he regards as "non-literature." But in illuminating his approach to fiction, Butler can be equally hard on his own work, and discusses various issues by analyzing its faults&#x2014;for instance, that good dialogue isn't expository, it has subtext. To illustrate his positive points, he draws on works ranging from Margaret Atwood's to the Old Testament. The book also features works by students and thoughtful class discussions of them, and closes with Butler's story "Open Arms," discussed in earlier sections. Butler shares his insights into&#x2014;and passion for&#x2014;the creation and experience of fiction with total openness, and seriously aspiring writers should receive this text/manifesto in the same light. <i>Agent, Kim Witherspoon. (Apr.) </i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.There's no doubt that Pulitzer Prize winner Butler, whose many fictional works include <i>Had a Good Time</i> [BKL My 1 04], knows how to write literary fiction, and it comes as no surprise that his approach to teaching fiction writing is intense, given the venturesome nature of his work. Butler taped his lectures, thus preserving their dynamism, and the edited result is a remarkably candid, clarifying, and profoundly demanding how-to. Butler's credo is, "Art does not come from the mind. Art comes from the place where we dream." Consequently, he teaches wanna-be fiction writers not how to brainstorm but how to "dreamstorm," and explains why fiction must be rooted in sensual experience, how cinematic techniques create narrative flow, and how "yearning" must be the driving force in every story. Butler's electrifying theories are backed by illuminating examples and startling practices (you'll never look at index cards in the same way again).

Published in conjunction with the first comprehensive retrospective of the artist&#x2019;s epically diverse body of work, this publication encompasses Genzken&#x2019;s work in all media over the past 40 years and is the most complete monograph on the artist available in English. Genzken has been part of the artistic discourse since she began exhibiting in the mid-1970s, but over the last decade a new generation of artists has been inspired by her radical inventiveness. The past ten years have been particularly productive for Genzken, who has created several bodies of work that have redefined assemblage for a new era. The catalogue presents Genzken&#x2019;s career, through essays exploring the unfolding of her practice from 1973 until today, as well as an expansive plate section that provides a chronological overview of all her most important bodies of work and key exhibitions.<br><br>Born in Germany in 1948, <b>Isa Genzken</b> is one of Germany&#x2019;s most important living artists. In the mid-1970s, as a student at D�sseldorf&#x2019;s renowned Kunstakademie, she created geometric wood sculptures, which gained her early international acclaim (she exhibited these works at Documenta 7 and the Venice Biennale in 1982). Since then, she has made sculptures in plaster, concrete and epoxy resin. Ranging in size from maquettes to monumental, these abstract works are influenced by Minimalism, but are decidedly narrative. Paintings that examine ideas of surface and light, as well as photographs, collages, artist&#x2019;s books and films, followed in the 1990s. From the late 90s on, Genzken began to create increasingly complex sculptural installations.</p><p>This catalogue accompanies a comprehensive exhibition of the same title organized by curators in New York, Chicago, and Dallas. Breitweiser (formerly, MoMA) provides a narrative description of Genzken's early career from 1970 to 1996, interweaving artistic development and biography. Laura Hoptman does the same for the years 1993 to the present, the period of assemblage constructions for which Genzken is now best known. The remarkable diversity of Genzken's oeuvre across four decades--from early minimalist sculpture to film to assemblage--is evident in the extensive selection of color images. Shown together, they reveal Genzken to be a consummate experimenter. The heterogeneity of her practice is also the topic of an essay by Michael Darling. Jeffrey Grove explores the self-referential elements that thread through much of Genzken's work. Lisa Lee examines how Genzken's sculptural constructions model historical precedents, revealing Genzken's acuity as a student of art history. The catalogue includes a biographical chronology and selected exhibition history. Summing Up: Recommended. Lower-level undergraduates and above. (D. L. Schuld <i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>Even for those familiar with Genzken's art, the size and breadth of her oeuvre is likely to come as a surprise. (Anne Doran <i>Art in America</i>)<br><br>[...] Among the nearly 150 works, it's Genzken's towering assemblages of found objects (from a metal dolly to plastic flowers) that best convey her acute inventiveness. (Kevin Gray <i>Details</i>)<br><br>As almost every rigorous essay here is at paints to point out, Genzken's oeuvre is as diverse as it is directed. How do we understand work spanning such a wide spectrum of material and meaning, work that, as Lee writes, is just as likely to reference Donald Duck as Donald Judd? In these pages we encounter post - Minimalism via giant "knitting needle" sculptures from the 1970s; photographs featuring the ears of strangers encountered on the street; the stunning Weltempfanger (World Receiver), 1987-1989, its radio antennas sticking out from mute concrete blocks; [...] Like the best of its genre, this catalogue makes one impatient to see the exhibition. Everybody needs her own view. (Prudence Peiffer <i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>"Hers is a career in which she is constantly reinventing herself, and yet she remains very focused on architectural forms," Hoptman says. Raised in Berlin immediately after the Second World War, Genzken was fascinated by the destruction and construction of cities. " Her concrete sculptures look just like the rubble that was Berlin after 1945," Hopman says. But Genzken's work is not purely, or even primarily, autobiographical. It also deeply engaged with art history. (Julia Halperin <i>The Art Newspaper</i>)Among the most celebrated contemporary European artists, Genzken is less known to an American audience. Her relative obscurity will end this fall with the artist's first US retrospective, which opened in November at the Museum of Modern Art (New York) and will travel to co-organizing institutions in Dallas and Chicago. The catalogue is therefore a crucial primer, handily consolidating critical writings covering over four decades of Genzken's art. [...] Although lacking essays by a few prominent critical voices (Benjamin Buchloh is noticeably absent, if everywhere quoted), <i>Isa Genzken: Retrospective</i> provides an exhaustive chronology, exhibition history, and bibliography (by Stephanie Weber). The book outlines key collaborative figures throughout the artist's career, including Buchloh, Gerhard Richter (to whom Genzken was married for just over a decade), Kai Althoff, and Wolfgang Tillmans, whose photographic portraits of the artist, particularly <i>Isa, dancing</i>, from 1995, are revelatory and happily pop up in the book (as well as in Genzken's sculpture).

There he redescribed the Enlightenment idea of universal scientific truth, arguing that there are no facts separable from their fabrication. In this concise work, Latour delves into the &#x201c;belief in naive belief,&#x201d; the suggestion that fetishes&#x2014;objects invested with mythical powers&#x2014;are fabricated and that facts are not. Mobilizing his work in the anthropology of science, he uses the notion of &#x201c;factishes&#x201d; to explore a way of respecting the objectivity of facts and the power of fetishes without forgetting that both are fabricated. While the fetish-worshipper knows perfectly well that fetishes are man-made, the Modern icon-breaker inevitably erects new icons. Yet Moderns sense no contradiction at the core of their work. Latour pursues his critique of critique, or the possibility of mediating between subject and object, or the fabricated and the real, through the notion of &#x201c;iconoclash,&#x201d; making productive comparisons between scientific practice and the worship of visual images and religious icons.</p><p>&#34;Bruno Latour&#39;s is a joyous and generous science, not a warmongering, invidious one. His unique intellectual trajectory beautifully replicates those strange objects he was the first fully to discern. A spontaneous reflexivity, an iconic quality of its own. For his work is eminently suitable to an actor-network treatment; it thrives on associations, it deals in mediations; it articulates heterogeneous modes of existence; it modulates its own regime of enunciation as the truth it describes changes its own conditions of production. What started as a &#39;social description of scientific practice&#39; morphed into a radical redescription of the social at least as much as of science itself, and it broke into bloom as a daring project of a general anthropology of truth, within which facts and fetishes, divine forces and material forms, art and science, religion and law, all are made to inhabit a virtual plane of coexistence which we are challengingly invited to bring into actuality as our common world.&#34;--Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, Museu Nacional (Rio de Janeiro)<p>Bruno Latour is Professor and Dean for Research at Sciences Po in Paris.

The endpapers lead in nicely, showing a wall of photographs of the families about to descend on Grandma and Grandpa&#x2019;s house for an unnamed winter holiday. Each family (some are mixed race, one includes two fathers) has its own journey to make by land, sea, or air (a hot-air balloon even comes into play), and each hits a snag, requiring rescue by a horse-drawn sleigh. Smith&#x2019;s lively digital illustrations include plenty of visual jokes to pore over, and the diverse cast, non-specificity of the holiday being celebrated, and all-too-familiar travel woes make for a thoroughly relatable and enjoyable story.

Four families&#x2014;nuclear, biracial, adoptive, and gay&#x2014;head to the grandparents&#x2019; house for Thanksgiving. Coming from different parts of the U.S., the families make their ways to grandma&#x2019;s house via car, train, plane, and boat. But problems occur en route&#x2014;the car runs out of gas, the rental lot at the train station is empty, a tire goes flat on the airport shuttle, and so on.

In this erudite and profusely illustrated history, <b>Barry Cunliffe</b> explores the archaeological reality of these bold warriors and skilled craftsmen of barbarian Europe who inspired fear in the Greeks and Romans. Tracing the emergence of chiefdoms and their migrations as far as Bosnia and the Czech Republic, he assesses the disparity between the traditional and contemporary information on the Celts and offers new insight into the true identity of this ancient people.</p><p>Each generation, the British scholar Jacquetta Hawkes has observed, chooses the archaeology that best suits its current ideology. For a century beginning in the late 1800s, archaeologists depicted the Celts as an inordinately brave and poetic tribal people who battled their way across the Eurasian world without being unduly aggressive--in the manner, that is, of good colonialists. Today some archaeologists are more inclined to consider the Celts as a people who kept ethnic unity alive across a huge span of territory and time, a view that may offer comfort in a time when, as Oxford University professor Barry Cunliffe writes, &#34;ethnic divisions are becoming a painful and disturbing reality.&#34; Cunliffe himself takes the view that the Celts were at once alike and diverse, which led to the formation of many different Celtic cultures from the Black Sea to Ireland. This heavily illustrated, well-written book tells their story well, from the beginnings of Celtic culture in the distant Indo-European past to the height of Celtic power in the third century A.D.For two and a half thousand years the Celts have continued to fascinate those who have come into contact with them, yet their origins have remained a mystery and even today are the subject of heated debate among historians and archaeologists.<p>In this erudite and engaging illustrated history, Professor Cunliffe explores the archaeological reality of these bold warriors and skilled craftsmen of barbarian Europe who inspired fear in the Greeks and Romans.

Now, for the first time, Kissinger gives us in a single volume an in-depth, inside view of the Vietnam War, personally collected, annotated, revised, and updated from his bestselling memoirs and his book <i>Diplomacy.</i> <br> Here, Kissinger writes with firm, precise knowledge, supported by meticulous documentation that includes his own memoranda to and replies from President Nixon. He tells about the tragedy of Cambodia, the collateral negotiations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the disagreements within the Nixon and Ford administrations, the details of all negotiations in which he was involved, the domestic unrest and protest in the States, and the day-to-day military to diplomatic realities of the war as it reached the White House. As compelling and exciting as Barbara Tuchman's <i>The Guns of August, Ending the Vietnam War</i> also reveals insights about the bigger-than-life personalities -- Johnson, Nixon, de Gaulle, Ho Chi Minh, Brezhnev -- who were caught up in a war that forever changed international relations. This is history on a grand scale, and a book of overwhelming importance to the public record.</p><p>Henry Kissinger was the fifty-sixth Secretary of State. Born in Germany, Dr. Kissinger came to the United States in 1938 and was naturalized a US citizen in 1943. He served in the US Army and attended Harvard University, where he&nbsp;later became a member of the faculty. Among the awards he has received are the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Medal of Liberty. Dr. Kissinger is currently Chairman of Kissinger Associates, Inc., an international consulting firm.<b>Foreword</b> <p>This book deals with the way the United States ended its involvement in the longest war in its history, the one fought at the greatest geographic distance from America, with the least obvious relationship to previous concepts of national security, and the only war in which well-known Americans traveled to the enemy's capital to express solidarity with the enemy's goals and, on occasion, to broadcast from there.</p> <p>No war since the Civil War has seared the national consciousness like Vietnam. The controversies surrounding it tore the country apart while the war was raging, and its legacies shaped the national approach to foreign policy for a generation. Absolute distinctions between moral values and the national interest, between ideals and power, were invoked and, in time, supplanted the previous policy disputes of the Cold War period. This near civil war constrained American policy for long after the war itself was concluded.</p> <p>But history presents unambiguous alternatives only in the rarest of circumstances. Most of the time, statesmen must strike a balance between their values and their necessities or, to put it another way, they are obliged to approach their goals not in one leap but in stages, each by definition imperfect by absolute standards. It is always possible to invoke that imperfection as an excuse to recoil before responsibilities or as a pretext to indict one's own society. That gap can be closed only by faith in America's purposes. And that was increasingly challenged during the Vietnam war and its aftermath.</p> <p>The domestic divisions that grew out of Vietnam were generally treated in the public discourse as a clash between those who were "for" the war and those who were "against" it. That, however, was not the fundamental issue. Every administration in office during the Vietnam war sought to end it -- nearly desperately. The daunting and heartrending question was how to define this goal.</p> <p>For Richard Nixon, who inherited the task of extrication from Vietnam in 1969 in the fifth year of a massive overseas deployment, the overriding issue was how to keep faith with the tens of millions who, in reliance on American assurances, had tied their destiny to ours. Too, he sought to maintain American credibility toward allies and America's deterrent posture toward adversaries, attributes on which, in the judgment of four successive administrations of both major parties, the peace of the world depended. The critics thought the quest for credibility illusory and draining of America's substance. They saw the key issue as salvaging America's moral core by scuttling a doomed and allegedly immoral enterprise on almost any terms.</p> <p>In this manner, the war in Vietnam became for the United States the defining experience of the second half of the twentieth century. Even for those who lived through it at the center of events, the mood of that period is nearly impossible to recapture: the brash confidence in the universal applicability of America's prescriptions with which it all began and the progressive disillusionment with which it ended; the initial unity of purpose and the ultimate divisive trauma.</p> <p>It was the so-called greatest generation that entered Indochina in the heyday of American self-confidence. The Truman and Eisenhower administrations involved the United States in Indochina in the aftermath of the Berlin blockade and the Communist invasion of South Korea. The Kennedy and Johnson administrations sent combat troops to South Vietnam when North Vietnam occupied portions of Laos and Cambodia and engulfed Vietnam in a guerrilla war backed by regular North Vietnamese forces. The four Presidents from both major parties were applying -- with wide public support -- the strategy that had achieved the historic transformations of the decade following the Second World War: the Berlin blockade had been overcome, Europe had been rebuilt, Germany and Japan had been restored to the community of nations, the Soviet advance into Europe had been arrested, and Communist aggression in Korea had been checked. This strategy drew from the experiences of World War II a faith in the ability to deter aggression by building military positions of strength and from Roosevelt's New Deal a belief in economic and social progress to remove Communist opportunities for internal upheavals. At the time, there was virtually no opposition to this open-ended commitment to a global mission or to the conventional wisdom that Indochina was an essential outpost in the defense of liberty.</p> <p>But, by the end of the Johnson administration in 1968, frustration had set in. The strategy that had worked in every previous American war -- of wearing down the adversary by attrition -- could not succeed against guerrillas defending no specific territory, in a position to choose when and where to fight, and possessing supply lines through Laos and Cambodia. These countries became sanctuaries because of a bizarre interpretation of their neutral status that proscribed retaliation against North Vietnamese military bases from which Americans and South Vietnamese were being killed daily. Nor did the non-Communist countries of Indochina practice anything like the democracy of our European allies, throwing into question the moral purpose of the war. For those who had made the decision to send American troops, mounting self-doubt about the American role in Indochina compounded the despair caused by Kennedy's assassination.</p> <p>National comity and mutual respect gave way -- at least in intellectual, media, and policy circles -- to a rancorous and clamorous distrust. (General public support remained well above 50 percent throughout the war years.) The once near-universal faith in the uniqueness of America's values -- and their global relevance -- was replaced by growing self-doubt. Successive administrations became the target of critics who increasingly challenged the moral essence of American involvement abroad. Early doubts as to whether the war was winnable and concerns lest its cost exceed any possible benefits escalated into the proposition that the frustrations of Vietnam were caused by moral rot at the core of American life. Critics moved from questioning the worthiness of America's allies to challenging the worthiness of America itself, assailing its conduct not only in Vietnam but around the world.</p> <p>Nixon, who inherited this cauldron, held values which, for all his railing against the Establishment, paralleled those of the "greatest generation." He would not consider the unconditional withdrawal and overthrow the Saigon structure on which the North Vietnamese insisted until the end of his first term in 1972 and toward which American critics of the war were moving gradually but relentlessly. He was eager to end the war but not at the price of imposing a Communist government on the millions who had cast their lot in reliance on the promises of his predecessors. Nixon's motives were a mixture of moral and geopolitical conviction as he sought to reconcile America's postwar policy based on alliances and deterrence with domestic passions which, in his view, threatened the long-term American ability to build a world order based on free societies. Nixon feared for our alliances if America abdicated in Indochina; he was concerned about the impact on Soviet restraint if the United States simply abandoned what four administrations had affirmed, and he believed that a demonstration of American weakness in Asia would destroy the opening to China based in part on America's role in thwarting Soviet moves toward hegemony in Asia.</p> <p>But as he entered office, he found that by the end of the Johnson administration, the goal of victory had been abandoned and a commitment had been made to end the bombing of North Vietnam and to seek a negotiated compromise solution. These objectives had been affirmed by both candidates in the presidential campaign. No significant American political or intellectual leader opposed them.</p> <p>When a negotiated solution proved unattainable, Nixon proceeded unilaterally to implement his concept of an honorable withdrawal. In the process, he cut U.S. casualties from 1,200 a month at the end of the Johnson administration to thirty a month at the end of Nixon's first term. He unilaterally reduced American troops from 550,000 in 1969 to 30,000 in 1972. And he concluded an agreement to end the war when it was possible to do so without abandoning the allies that America had sustained.</p> <p>The stages in this process were often highly controversial partly because the liberal Establishment, which had launched America into the quagmire, had become demoralized and left the field to the radical protesters who, certain of their moral superiority, saw no need for restraint in the methods they used to pursue their ends. At the same time, the conservatives had abandoned the cause of Indochina in frustration while those who later emerged as passionate neoconservatives were as yet besieging the barricades from the side of the protest movement. Nor did Nixon possess the qualities to transcend the gulf in American society by an act of grace.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, I was drawn into the vortex. Though I had been the principal foreign policy adviser of Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, Nixon's political opponent for a decade, and though I had met the President-elect only once and then only for a few minutes, he did me the honor of appointing me as National Security Adviser. In that role, I was to become the principal adviser to the President on the policy for the extrication from Vietnam and eventually the chief negotiator.</p> <p>Like almost everyone involved in decisions affecting the future of Vietnam, I was beset by ambivalence. I was intellectually convinced that Hanoi would settle only if deprived of all hope of victory by a determined military strategy. But I was emotionally close to many of the more moderate of the protesters who had been my contemporaries at university; therefore I was also the principal advocate in the administration for negotiations for a political solution to give the people of Indochina a genuine opportunity to choose this future. It turned out to be a rough...</p></p><h2>The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure Cookbook: More Than 200 Delicious Recipes Featuring the Foods Proven to Lower Cholesterol</h2><p>Applying the principles outlined in &#34;The Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure,&#34; the author presents more than two hundred imaginative and easy-to-prepare recipes that can contribute to lower cholesterol levels</p><p>The companion to the 2-million-copy #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller!

The Timeless Way of Building. New York, Oxford University Press, 1979. 20 cm x 13,8 cm. XV, 552 pages. With several black-and-white illustrations throughout book. Original Hardcover. Very good condition with only minor signs of external wear. Only slightly foxed. Includes for example the following essays: Patterns which are alive / The multiplicity of living patterns / Our pattern languages / The creative power of language / The breakdown of language / The structure of language / The evolution of a common language / The genetic power of language / The process of construction / The slow emergence of a town / The kernel of the way etc etc. Christopher Wolfgang Alexander (born October 4, 1936 in Vienna, Austria) is an architect noted for his theories about design as well as over 200 building projects around the world. Reasoning that users know more about the buildings they need than any architect could, he produced and validated (in collaboration with Sarah Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein) a pattern language to empower anyone to design and build at any scale. He moved from England to the United States in 1958, living and teaching in Berkeley, California from 1963. Currently an emeritus professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Alexander lives in Arundel, England. Alexander is often overlooked by texts in the history and theory of architecture because his work intentionally disregards contemporary architectural discourse. However, Alexander&#39;s polyvalent approach to the discipline of architecture has had enormous ramifications through his vast corpus of essays and books. He is regarded as the father of the Pattern Language movement, and various contemporary architectural practices such as the New Urbanist movement have resulted from Alexander&#39;s ideas, which seek to help normal people reclaim control over their built environments.

Although apples became a major commercial crop in parts of the South in the late 1800s, for three hundred years southern farm families grew apples as an important, year-round food source. Through the selection and grafting of wild seedlings, Southerners developed unique apple varieties adapted to the climate and soils of the South and suited to specific uses such as drying, cider, apple butter and winter keeping. It is truly astonishing to learn that Southerners developed more than 1300 apple varieties and grew another 300 varieties of northern and European origins. <p>Old Southern Apples opens with an overview of apple history, culture, and uses in the agrarian South. This is followed by an exhaustive compilation of apple varieties grown in the South before 1928. The more than 1600 varieties are divided into extant and extinct groups, and all known facts concerning the history and description of each apple are given, plus a listing of synonyms. </p><p>Appendices include a bibliography, a description of nurseries, which sell old southern apple varieties, and an index of more than 3,600 apple names and synonyms. Forty-eight color plates painted by United States Department of Agriculture staff artists between 1880 and 1930 illustrate important varieties of southern apples. Old engravings and drawings illustrate apple cultivation and propagation practices in the South.</p></p><p>Lee Calhoun graduated from North Carolina State University in 1956 with a BS degree in Agronomy.

Formerly Senior Curator at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 2004 he curated the 5th SITE Sante Fe Biennial in New Mexico. Storr was a contributing author to Phaidon&#39;s Raymond Pettibon (2003), Alex Katz (2006) and Robert Mangold (2000).Paulo Herkenhoff is an independent curator and critic based in Rio de Janeiro. Formerly adjunct Curator in the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Herkenhoff was Artistic Director of the 24th Bienal de Sao Paulo (1999) and Curator of the Brazilian Pavilion of the 47th Venice Biennale (1997).Allan Schwartzman is an independent art critic who often contributes to The New York Times as well as many other journals and newspapers. Schwartzman is a longtime follower of Bourgeois&#39; work.This elegant volume is the second book about Bourgeois to appear in recent months, evidence of a surge of interest that Bernadac succinctly describes as "inversely proportional to the neglect" Bourgeois suffered for decades. Bernadac, former curator of the Musee Picasso, offers convincing explanations both for the art world's persistent blindness to Bourgeois' startlingly original, sensual, and challenging sculpture and for the sudden recognition of its power, integrity, and courageous beauty. Bernadac successfully combines biography with criticism throughout this chronological overview, enriching the experience of viewing Bourgeois' art, from her highly symbolic works on paper to her newest work, the "cells," mysterious and dramatic large-scale installations. These daring works have occupied the indefatigable Bourgeois since she entered her eighties five years ago. Fiercely independent, adept at creating provocative abstractions out of myriad materials, Bourgeois is "unclassifiable" and profoundly compelling, qualities attributable, Bernadac believes, to Bourgeois' perception of art as fetishistic. For Bourgeois, the making of art is a magical and curative act, deeply emotional and erotic, thus resoundingly universal. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Magic: A History of Its Rites, Rituals, and Mysteries (Dover Occult)</h2><p>"The most arresting, entertaining, and brilliant of all studies on the subject." &#x2014; Arthur Edward Waite<br>A great work of literature as well as a pioneering classic of occultism, this voluminous historical survey traces the roots and manifestations of magic through the ages as a secret tradition persisting from remote times. Author �liphas L�vi, pseudonym of Alphonse Louis Constant (1810-75), was a leader of the French occult revival, a spiritual teacher and magus who is today considered by some to be a founding father of the New Age movement. One of his most stunning (and original) revelations connects the Kabbalah with the Tarot, thus helping to inspire the ongoing fascination with the symbols of both, and their correspondences with each other. In this 1860 work, L�vi's discussions include topics that continue to intrigue modern readers, subjects as seemingly disparate as the mathematical magic of Pythagoras, magical monuments, magic and Christianity, the devil, the Knights Templar, alchemy, the illuminati, hallucinations, and many others that are equally alluring.<br>The first part of the book explains the principles underlying magical operations, while the second part addresses the actual ritual and practice of transcendent magic. An essential resource for the library of anyone interested in mysticism and the occult sciences, this influential work appears here in its first English translation (from the original French) by the distinguished scholar and co-creator of the Rider-Waite Tarot deck, A.

Enraged, Hitler reacts by lashing out at the West, promising his soldiers that they will reach Paris by the new year. They don&#x2019;t. Three years later, his genocidal apparatus not fully in place, Hitler has barely survived a coup, while Jews cling to survival. But England and France wonder whether the war is still worthwhile.<br><br>Weaving together a cast of characters that ranges from a brawling American fighter in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in Spain to a woman who has seen Hitler&#x2019;s evil face-to-face, Harry Turtledove takes us into a world shaping up very differently in 1941. The Germans and their Polish allies have slammed into the gut of the Soviet Union in the west, while Japan pummels away in the east. In trench warfare in France, French and Czech fighters are outmanned but not outfought by their Nazi enemy. Then the stalemate is shattered. In England, Winston Churchill dies in an apparent accident, and the gray men who walk behind his funeral cortege wonder who their real enemy is. The USSR, fighting for its life, makes peace with Japan&#x2014;and Japan&#x2019;s war with America is about to begin.<br><br>A sweeping saga of human passions, foolishness, and courage, of families and lovers and soldiers by choice and by chance, <i>The Big Switch</i> is a provocative, gripping, and utterly convincing work of alternate history at its best. For history buffs and fans of big, blood-and-guts fiction, Harry Turtledove delivers a panoramic clash of ideals as powerful as armies themselves.</p><p><b>Harry Turtledove</b> is the award-winning author of the alternate-history works <i>The Man with the Iron Heart, The Guns of the South,</i> and <i>How Few Remain</i> (winner of the Sidewise Award for Best Novel); the War That Came Early novels: <i>West and East</i> and <i>Hitler&#x2019;s War;</i> the Worldwar saga: <i>In the Balance, Tilting the Balance, Upsetting the Balance,</i> and <i>Striking the Balance;</i> the Colonization books: <i>Second Contact, Down to Earth,</i> and <i>Aftershocks;</i> the Great War epics: <i>American Front, Walk in Hell,</i> and <i>Breakthroughs;</i> the American Empire<i> </i>novels: <i>Blood &amp; Iron, The Center Cannot Hold,</i> and <i>Victorious Opposition;</i> and the Settling Accounts series: <i>Return Engagement, Drive to the East, The Grapple,</i> and <i>In at the Death</i>.

Crusted snow crunched under the Czech corporal's boots. Like anyone from central Europe thinking of France, he'd always imagined Paris blazing with lights and beaches on the Riviera packed with girls in skimpy bathing suits. Freezing his ass off in the middle of a war had never been in the cards.<br><br>But here he was, freezing his ass off. This would have been a nasty winter by Czech standards. From everything he could pick up-he spoke only foul fragments of French-it was a bloody godawful winter by French standards. Which didn't do anybody stuck in it one damn bit of good.<br><br>And here he was, in the middle of a war. And it was his own fault, too. When the Nazis jumped on Czechoslovakia in October 1938, he'd fought till he couldn't fight any more. Then he'd gone over the Polish border and let himself be interned. And then he'd agreed to join the forces of the Czech government-in-exile still fighting the Germans from its base in Paris.<br><br>A good thing, too, he thought, lighting a Gitane without breaking stride. He didn't breathe out much more fog with the cigarette than he had without it. Poland and Hitler were on the same side these days, both fighting the Russians. If he'd stayed in that internment camp, he'd probably be a German POW now.<br><br>Of course, he might yet end up a German POW. It wasn't as if the Nazis had gone out of business. They were playing defense in the west for the time being, not pushing toward Paris with everything they had. That was something. Things looked a lot better now than they had when Vaclav got to Paris. He could still get killed or maimed or captured if his number came up.<br><br>As if to underscore the point, German artillery grumbled off to the east. Shells screamed through the air. Vaclav cocked his head to one side, gauging their flight. This lot wouldn't come down anywhere close to him, so he kept marching.<br><br>The rest of the Czechs in his outfit made the same automatic calculation and did the same thing. They wore a motley mixture of Czech and French khaki uniforms. Most of them kept their domed Czech helmets in place of the crested French model. Vaclav did-he was convinced the Czech pot was made from thicker steel. The German Stahlhelm was better yet, but wearing one of those wouldn't do, not if he wanted to keep on breathing, anyway.<br><br>Most of the Czechs carried French rifles. That made sense. French quartermasters didn't want to have to worry about somebody else's ammunition.<br><br>Jezek, by contrast, listed to the right as he marched. The piece slung on his shoulder was longer and heavier than an ordinary foot slogger's rifle. It was made for wrecking tanks and armored cars. The 13mm armor-piercing slugs it fired would punch through twenty-five millimeters of hardened steel. It kicked like a jackass, too, despite padded stock and muzzle brake, but everything came with a price.<br><br>It also made one hell of a sniping rifle. Those big bullets flew fast and flat. And when one hit a mere human being, it commonly killed. Vaclav had picked off Germans out to a kilometer and a half. And he'd picked off a German sniper specially sent out to get rid of him: a compliment he could have done without.<br><br>Those 105s in the distance rumbled again. Again, Jezek cocked his head to one side. This time, he didn't like what he heard. "Hit the dirt!" he yelled. He wasn't the only one. The cry went up in Czech and French.<br><br>Even in his greatcoat, even with wool long johns, doing a belly flop into the snow wasn't his idea of fun. And the goddamn antitank rifle thumped him when he landed. The stupid thing wasn't content with bruising his shoulder every time he fired it. Oh, no. It wanted to leave black-and-blue marks all over him.<br><br>But snow and bruises weren't so bad, not when you set them alongside of getting blasted into ground beef. Half a dozen shells came down not nearly far enough away from the Czech detachment. Fire at the heart of the burst, dirt and black smoke rising from it, fragments whining and screeching through the air . . . Vaclav had been through it more often than he cared to remember. It never got any easier.<br><br>Nobody was screaming his head off. That was good, to say nothing of lucky. They'd flattened out soon enough, and none of the shards of steel and brass decided to skim the ground and bite somebody regardless.<br><br>A couple of Czech soldiers started to get to their feet. "Stay down!" Sergeant Benjamin Hal�vy shouted from right behind Jezek. "They may not be done with us."<br><br>Sure as hell, another volley came in half a minute later. One Czech swore and hissed like a viper, but only one. Bright red blood steamed in the snow under his leg. It didn't look like a bad wound-but then, any wound you didn't get yourself wasn't so bad.<br><br>As the injured man bandaged around, Vaclav twisted around (trying his best to stay flat while he did it) and told the sergeant, "You may be a Jew, but at least you're a smart Jew."<br><br>"Fuck you, Jezek," Hal�vy answered evenly. "If I'm so smart, what am I doing here?" He was redheaded and freckle-faced. He was a French noncom, not a Czech. His folks had brought him from Prague to Paris when he was little. Equally fluent in Czech and French, he served as a liaison between the government-in-exile's troops and his host country's army.<br><br>Before the war started, Vaclav hadn't had much use for Jews. But, in Czechoslovakia and now here, he'd seen that you could count on them to fight the Nazis with everything they had. Anybody who'd do that was all right in his book. Plenty of Slovaks had thrown down their rifles and hugged the first German they saw. Slovakia was "independent" these days, though the next time Father Tiso did anything Germany didn't like would be the first.<br><br>Since Hal�vy was a smart Jew, Vaclav asked him, "What d'you think? Can we get up now, or will those shitheads try to be really cute and throw some more shit at us?"<br><br>"What did I do to deserve getting asked to think like a German all the time?" The sergeant seemed to aim the question more at God than at Vaclav Jezek. That was good: God might have an answer, and Vaclav sure didn't. After screwing up his features, Hal�vy went on, "I think maybe it's all right. Maybe."<br><br>"Yeah, me, too. C'mon. Let's try it." Vaclav scrambled to his feet. Snow clung to the front of his greatcoat. He didn't try to brush it off. If it made him harder for the poor, shivering bastards in snow- spotted Feldgrau to spot, so much the better. Hal�vy followed his lead. So did the rest of the Czechs. They moved with no great enthusiasm, but they moved.<br><br>Stretcher-bearers carried the wounded man back towards a dressing station. Some of the other guys eyed them enviously: they were out of danger, or at least in less of it, for a while.<br><br>The German guns growled again. Jezek tensed, but these shells headed somewhere else. He nodded to himself. The artillerymen had a prescribed firing pattern, and by God they'd stick to it. Of course they would. They were Germans, weren't they?<br><br>A stretch of snow-covered open ground several hundred meters wide lay ahead, with woods beyond. Vaclav eyed it sourly. He turned to Hal�vy. "What do you want to bet the Nazis have a machine-gun nest in amongst the trees?"<br><br>"I won't touch that," the Jew answered. "And there'll be two more farther back covering it, so when we take it out it won't do us much good." He seemed no happier than Vaclav, and with reason. "Be expensive even getting close enough to take it out."<br><br>Vaclav unslung the antitank rifle, which made his shoulder smile happily. "If we send a few guys forward to draw their fire, maybe I can do something about it at long range. Worth a try, anyhow."<br><br>"Suits," Hal�vy said at once. He told off half a squad of Czechs to serve as lures. They looked as miserable as Jezek would have in their boots. The rest of the men looked relieved. A well-sited MG-34 could have slaughtered half of them, maybe more.<br><br>Flopping down into the snow again, Vaclav steadied the monster on its bipod. He aimed where he would have put the gun if he were on the other side. Even with a telescopic sight, he couldn't see anything funny. But nothing could hide a machine-gun muzzle when it started spitting fire. And maybe-he hoped-he'd spot motion when the crew served the gun.<br><br>Like sacrificial pawns, the handful of Czechs started crossing the field. They hadn't gone far before the machine gun opened up on them. That was German arrogance. Letting them come farther might have drawn more after them. But the Nazis were saying, Thus far and no farther. This is our ground.<br><br>They could think so. Vaclav shifted the rifle a few millimeters-he'd guessed well. Blam! He winced even as he chambered a fresh round. Muzzle brake or not, padded stock or not, shooting that mother hurt every goddamn time. His right ear would never be the same again, either.<br><br>Blam! This time, the scope let him see a German reel away with his head nothing but a red ruin. Another one stepped up. They wouldn't have caused so much trouble if they weren't brave. Blam! He killed that one, too, and then another one a few seconds later. "Forward!" Hal�vy shouted. "Everybody forward!"<br><br>Forward the Czechs went. More Germans ran over to keep the machine gun firing. Vaclav methodically shot them. Before long, his side had a lodgement in the woods. The MG-34 fell silent. Maybe they'd captured it, or maybe the guys on the other side had pulled it back.<br><br>Either way, he could go forward himself now. Another few hundred meters reclaimed. Sooner or later, the rest of France. Later-how much later?-Czechoslovakia. It would take a while. Oh, yes. The antitank rifle seemed to weigh a tonne.<br><br>theo hossbach stood in front of the goal of what had to be the worst football pitch he'd ever seen. The Polish field was frozen and lumpy. The ball could have used more air, but nobody could find a valve that fit its air inlet. Nobody much cared, either. The German soldiers were back of the line for a while. The Ivans weren't shooting at them, so they were letting off some steam.<br><br>The match was panzer black against infantry Feldgrau. Theo was the radio operator in a Panzer II. His black coverall wasn't warm enough. His teammates heated themselves up running and falling and bumping into one another-and into the Landsers on the other side. A goalkeeper just stood there, waiting for something horrible to happen . . . and freezing while he waited. Theo didn't complain. He never did. Come to that, he rarely said anything at all. He lived as much of his life as he could inside his own head.<br><br>If he had been moved to complain, he would have bitched about the quality of the match in front of him. Both sides would have been booed off the pitch if they'd had the gall to try to charge admission to an exhibition like this. He wasn't the best 'keeper himself, but he liked to watch well-played football. This was more like a mob of little kids running and yelling and booting the ball any which way.<br><br>One of the guys in black missed a pass he should have been able to field blindfolded. A fellow in field-gray seized control of the ball. The mob thundered toward Theo. He tensed. A good defense would have stopped the attack before it got anywhere near him. Unfortunately, a good defense was nowhere to be found, not here.<br><br>He also tensed because there was liable to be an argument if one got past him. He hated arguments. And the makeshift goals were made for them. A couple of sticks pounded into the ground marked each one's edges; a string ran from the top of one stick to the top of the other at more or less the right height. No net to stop the ball. Did somebody score or not? There'd already been two or three shouting matches.<br><br>But he didn't have to worry, not this time. A tall man in black headed the ball away from danger before the incoming infantry could launch it at Theo. "Way to go, Adi!" one of the other panzer crewmen yelled. Theo couldn't have put it better himself.<br><br>Adalbert Stoss took the praise in stride-literally. He ran the ball down, took it on the side of his foot, and expertly steered it up the field. Theo watched his back with proprietary admiration. Adi drove the panzer on which he himself ran the radio.<br><br>Smooth and precise as an English pro, Adi sent a pass to the right wing, then dashed into position in front of the other side's goal. For a wonder, the guy to whom he sent the pass didn't let it roll past the touchline. For a bigger wonder, he sent back a halfway decent centering pass. And Adi booted it past two defenders and the infantry's 'keeper.<br><br>"Goal!" the panzer men yelled, pumping their fists in the air. The soldiers in Feldgrau couldn't argue, not about that one.<br><br>Glumly, the infantrymen started from the halfway line. Before they'd done much, Adi Stoss swooped in and commandeered the ball. He charged up the pitch with it, sliding past Landsers as if they were nailed to the dirt. Only a wild, desperate lunge from the enemy 'keeper kept him from scoring again.<br><br>"No fair," a panting foot soldier-right now a footsore foot soldier- complained. "You fuckers snuck a ringer in on us."<br><br>"Like hell we did." The closest panzer man pointed back toward Theo. "He's in the same crew as our goalkeeper."<br><br>"Scheisse," the Landser said. "You ought to take him out anyway. He's too damn good."<br><br>"I didn't know, that wasn't in the rules," the panzer man replied.<br><br>"Well, it ought to be," the foot soldier said, bending over and setting his hands on his knees so he could catch his breath. "Playing against him is like going up against a machine gun with water pistols." He looked up. "Christ, here he comes again." Shaking his head, he clumped off.<br><br>Theo had known Adi Stoss was uncommonly fast and strong, even among the extraordinarily fit men of the Wehrmacht. He'd never seen him play football before. He was even more impressed than he'd thought he might be. If Adi wasn't good enough to make his living in short pants, Theo couldn't imagine anybody who would be.<br><br>Thanks largely to his efforts, the panzer side beat the infantrymen, 7-4. Soldiers in black passed bottles of the distilled lightning the Poles brewed from potatoes to soldiers in field-gray. Theo was glad to get outside some of the vodka. He wasn't normally much of a drinking man, but in weather like this he figured he needed antifreeze as much as his panzer did.<br><br>Sergeant Hermann Witt, the commander of Adi and Theo's machine, had run up and down the rutted field. He put an arm around Adi's shoulder. "Man, I didn't know you could play like that," he said<br><br>expansively-his other hand clutched a bottle.<br><br>"Fat lot of good it does me." Adi sounded surprisingly bitter.<br><br>"You just made those ground pounders look like a bunch of jerks," Witt said. "Nothing wrong with that. They think we're out of shape because we don't tramp like horses all day long. I guess you showed 'em different."<br><br>"I like to play. That's all there is to it." Adi shook himself free of the sergeant.</p><h2>KON-TIKI: Across the Pacific</h2><p>A story of a great adventure about Heyerdah&#39;ls theory, the long voyage and experiences to prove that it was true.

He lives in Baltimore.At our end of the island, far from any noisy taverna or buzzing scooter, two owls hold a nightly conversation in the treetops by the sea. They start around midnight, hooting back and forth like village gossips while the landscape stands at attention. The only interruption is the slap and sigh of the Aegean, a timeless incantation that seems to whisper of myth and fallen heroes.<br><br>I like to imagine the owls are offering a sort of predator hotline, with frequent updates on the whereabouts of targets in the shadows below. After all, they&#x2019;re the professionals at that sort of business. Maybe that&#x2019;s why I was listening so closely on the night in question. Break their code and I&#x2019;d learn which creatures were at risk&#x2013;Freeman Lockhart, power broker of the local animal kingdom, beneficent warlord of meadow and brook.<br><br>Obviously I failed. Because nothing in their tone caused me the slightest alarm, yet shortly after the hooting stopped, three predators in gray tracksuits crept into our bedroom, and later I realized that every creature but me must have detected a warning. Even Mila, shivering at my side until they took me away, bruised and bleeding, had noticed the fellows earlier that day on the ferry from Piraeus.<br><br>My only vivid memory of our ocean passage was of Mila herself as she prepared to vomit from the stern. She wasn&#x2019;t prone to seasickness, but there she stood, hands braced against the rail in a swirl of briny mist while gulls hovered just above, awaiting the spoils. Her face was pale, accentuating the underfed look of her sharp features and high cheekbones. She looked as vulnerable as a stowaway, so I took her gently by the shoulders in hopes of steadying her with a little warmth.<br><br>&#x201c;Must be the excitement,&#x201d; she gasped, still holding it inside.<br><br>&#x201c;Probably,&#x201d; I answered, although I suspected trepidation was more to blame. This voyage was our running start to a long-planned leap of faith, our grand exit to a new life. Having given up on the world at large, we had decided to finally get everything right by going it alone. Stakes like those might make anyone queasy.<br><br>We had been at sea for several hours, among fifty or so passengers on one of the few remaining smaller boats&#x2013;or ca�ques&#x2013;that still ply these waters. Most people make the crossing to Karos in half the time, on one of the huge hydroplane &#x201c;fast boats.&#x201d; But Mila and I share an aversion for their towering hulls, wide-body cabins, and churning speed. They are as coldly efficient as 747s. Being a firm believer in clean getaways, I am also unsettled by their tremendous wakes, mile-long stripes of foam across the sea, pointing a giant arrow at your route of escape.<br><br>Besides, when you&#x2019;re going somewhere for the duration, you want to be attuned to the passing of every mile. So we opted for the smaller, slower sort of boat we had taken on our first trip to Karos, three years earlier. What we hadn&#x2019;t counted on was the bluster of early autumn, which soon built the Aegean into ten-foot waves as the deck heaved<br>beneath us. <br><br>After a few minutes of unproductive gagging, Mila finally cut loose. The waiting gulls cried sharply in triumph, yellow beaks plucking at her discharge as it streamed toward the foaming water. They fought noisily over the bounty. <br><br>&#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; I asked, massaging her back.<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>She barely got the word out. Then she pushed away my hand and thrust her face back toward the water. I made my exit toward the bow, not for lack of empathy but because of the memories she had stirred. The transaction with the gulls reminded me uncomfortably of our recent profession and all its shortcomings. Until a week ago, Mila and I were aid workers for the United Nations, acting as glorified caterers to the world&#x2019;s wars, famines, and disasters. Most recently we had supervised feeding centers, handing out rations which at times were scarcely more palatable than what Mila had just offered, and usually to an audience every bit as ravenous as the gulls. <br><br>Toward the front of the pitching deck, several backpacking young tourists stood with knees flexed and sunburned faces to the wind, riding the rollers like surfers. I grasped the rail, still trying to shake the images that had pursued me from the stern. Closing my eyes, I saw skeletal mobs racing through dust clouds toward air-dropped crates of bottled water. Eager hands tore away plastic before the parachute even had time to settle. In the foamy sizzle of the passing sea I detected the crackle of gunfire, and as I reopened my eyes I imagined the wounded falling by the wayside in the troughs of retreating waves.<br><br>The deck bounced as the boat carved another blue swell, and I looked anew at the surroundings, trying to place myself more firmly in the moment. The light was golden, the air mild, and my lips pleasantly salty. The other passengers at the bow seemed to be enjoying themselves, and I should have been, too. Karos was only an hour away. <br><br>Just ahead on the horizon lay the isle of Argos. I shielded my eyes for a closer look, but the whitewashed houses seemed to trickle down the island&#x2019;s crags like droplets of spilled milk, yet another reminder of<br>squandered nutrition.<br><br>Years ago in Sudan, toward the end of one particularly exhausting day, a village chieftain with arms and legs like pipe cleaners strolled into our makeshift headquarters and, without asking a soul, tacked onto a tent post a little gift from his family. It was an embroidered inscription of the famous biblical passage from Ecclesiastes, the one about casting your bread upon the waters. I had of course heard it repeated many times&#x2013;one always does in the aid racket&#x2013;but it was the latter, lesserknown portion that snagged in my memory now: &#x201c;Give a portion to seven, yes, to eight, for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.&#x201d;<br><br>Indeed you don&#x2019;t. Especially when, thanks to the well-meaning actions of those you hold dearest, you end up with only enough for six. But that is another story, and only I am privy to its deepest secrets.<br><br>A huge thump of the prow slapped away the thought with a blast of spray. Foaming water swabbed the deck in a bracing dose of autumn, and I gasped in exhilarated relief. I barely managed to keep my footing, and the bearded passenger to my left roared with laughter.<br><br>&#x201c;Almost got us, that one!&#x201d; he shouted above the wind, a Scotsman by the sound of his accent.<br><br>I made the mistake of agreeing in English, which only encouraged him.<br><br>&#x201c;Here on holiday?&#x201d; he yelled.<br><br>&#x201c;No. We live here.&#x201d; He leaned closer to hear. &#x201c;As of today, anyway. I&#x2019;ve just retired.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Congratulations! You look too young for it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe I am. I&#x2019;m fifty-five.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no. Everyone should be so bloody lucky. Give me a place in these isles and I&#x2019;d quit in a fuckin&#x2019; minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Quit was the word for it, all right. But reborn, too. At least, that was the plan. Time to stand tall in the front lines of self-sufficiency, with a fishing rod in one hand and a shotgun for hunting in the other, while Mila tended to orchard and garden. Henceforth, any bread we tossed upon the waters would be for our own mouths. Let the next disaster proceed without us, because our former selves were finished, dismantled.<br><br>Our new hopes were thanks mostly to Mila. She was thirty-seven, a Bosnian whom I met in &#x2019;92 during her country&#x2019;s civil war. We were living and working in besieged Sarajevo then, a time when the fates seemed to be conspiring against her and her country. I was fortunate enough to be able to help her survive the experience in one piece, both physically and emotionally, and when the war ended she was ready to go with me anywhere as long as it got her out of there for good. The UN, far more nimble at accommodating unofficial requests than official ones, obliged our wishes to travel in tandem even though we weren&#x2019;t yet married, and for several years running we were island hoppers of African famine for the World Food Programme. Mila viewed each stop as yet another chance to remake the planet in a better image, even as she was repairing her own damage. We have always been quick to rise to the defense of ideals. It&#x2019;s one thing that made us such a good match, although she has always been the more tactful practitioner. Cross a line into dangerous misconduct and we will both draw it to your attention, but her gentler voice will be the one you want to heed. I have given some thought to why my tone is more cynical and strident, and I&#x2019;ve decided it is due to my higher rank in the aid bureaucracy, which afforded a better view of the way things really work. Lucky her. <br><br>&#x201c;Pretty, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; The Scotsman pointed back toward Argos, receding in our wake. <br><br>I nodded to be friendly, but I had never liked the look of Argos. Too barren. Too brown and imposing. In the afternoon light the villages protruded from its ridgelines like bones through rotting flesh, and I was unable to suppress a shudder.<br><br>&#x201c;If you think <i>this </i>water&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; the grinning Scotsman said, &#x201c;then don&#x2019;t ever take a dip in the North Sea.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good advice. Excuse me. I should go find my wife.&#x201d;<br><br>It must have been around then that Mila noticed the three men. She told me later that after a second purging she felt well enough to head back inside, where she cleaned up using sterile wipes that I&#x2019;d pilfered the last day on the job. While doing so she idly surveyed the aisles of passengers.<br><br>They were together on the back row. What caught her attention was that none of the three appeared to be either a Greek or a vacationer. Karos wasn&#x2019;t exactly a business destination, yet their attire of smart slacks and button-down oxford shirts was trademark business casual. Each had a single overnight bag close at hand. It was...</p><h2>Sex Among Allies</h2><p>This study examines and illuminates how the lives of Korean prostitutes in the 1970s served as the invisible underpinnings to US-Korean military policies at the highest level.</p><p>Katherine H. S. Moon is assistant professor of political science at Wellesley College.In a carefully researched study of U.S. military prostitution in Korea, Moon validates Cynthia Enloe&#39;s claim that the personal is international. These moving stories tell how the lives of Korean prostitutes in the 1970s served as nearly invisible instruments of U.S.-Korean military policies at the highest level. Moon&#39;s innovative case study demonstrates how a Cold War alliance was maintained at the price of these women&#39;s personal insecurity and challenges us to reconsider the human costs of international security policies.

After he has had several kitchen disasters, Grandmother, Maggie, and the neighbors save Mr. Whiskers' pride and birthday feast. A subplot of a stray puppy that Mr. Whiskers saves and returns is wrapped up when young Maggie gives him a puppy from the same litter as a birthday gift. Characterization is minimal, dialogue is sometimes uninspired, but the story moves along too quickly for these to become major flaws here. The book is a bit lengthy for the littlest listeners, but fans of Cranberryport will be glad to see their friends again. Joanna G.

He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#39;plant-like&#39; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&#39;s decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister&#39;s husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and becoming - impossibly, ecstatically - a tree. Fraught, disturbing and beautiful, The Vegetarian is a novel about modern day South Korea, but also a novel about shame, desire and our faltering attempts to understand others, from one imprisoned body to another.</p><p>HAN KANG was born in Gwangju, South Korea, and moved to Seoul at the age of ten.

To be frank, the first time I met her I wasn&#x2019;t even attracted to her. Middling height; bobbed hair neither long nor short; jaundiced, sickly-looking skin; somewhat prominent cheekbones; her timid, sallow aspect told me all I needed to know. As she came up to the table where I was waiting, I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice her shoes &#x2013; the plainest black shoes imaginable. And that walk of hers &#x2013; neither fast nor slow, striding nor mincing.</p><p>However, if there wasn&#x2019;t any special attraction, nor did any particular drawbacks present themselves, and therefore there was no reason for the two of us not to get married. The passive personality of this woman in whom I could detect neither freshness nor charm, or anything especially refined, suited me down to the ground. There was no need to affect intellectual leanings in order to win her over, or to worry that she might be comparing me to the preening men who pose in fashion catalogues, and she didn&#x2019;t get worked up if I happened to be late for one of our meetings. The paunch that started appearing in my mid-twenties, my skinny legs and forearms that steadfastly refused to bulk up in spite of my best efforts, the inferiority complex I used to have about the size of my penis &#x2013; I could rest assured that I wouldn&#x2019;t have to fret about such things on her account.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve always inclined towards the middle course in life. At school I chose to boss around those who were two or three years my junior, and with whom I could act the ringleader, rather than take my chances with those my own age, and later I chose which college to apply to based on my chances of obtaining a scholarship large enough for my needs. Ultimately, I settled for a job where I would be provided with a decent monthly salary in return for diligently carrying out my allotted tasks, at a company whose small size meant they would value my unremarkable skills. And so it was only natural that I would marry the most run-of-the-mill woman in the world. As for women who were pretty, intelligent, strikingly sensual, the daughters of rich families &#x2013; they would only ever have served to disrupt my carefully ordered existence.</p><p>In keeping with my expectations, she made for a completely ordinary wife who went about things without any distasteful frivolousness. Every morning she got up at six a.m. to prepare rice and soup, and usually a bit of fish. From adolescence she&#x2019;d contributed to her family&#x2019;s income through the odd bit of part-time work. She ended up with a job as an assistant instructor at the computer graphics college she&#x2019;d attended for a year, and was subcontracted by a manhwa publisher to work on the words for their speech bubbles, which she could do from home.</p><p>She was a woman of few words. It was rare for her to demand anything of me, and however late I was in getting home she never took it upon herself to kick up a fuss. Even when our days off happened to coincide, it wouldn&#x2019;t occur to her to suggest we go out somewhere together. While I idled the afternoon away, TV remote in hand, she would shut herself up in her room. More than likely she would spend the time reading, which was practically her only hobby. For some unfathomable reason, reading was something she was able to really immerse herself in &#x2013; reading books that looked so dull I couldn&#x2019;t even bring myself to so much as take a look inside the covers. Only at mealtimes would she open the door and silently emerge to prepare the food. To be sure, that kind of wife, and that kind of lifestyle, did mean that I was unlikely to find my days particularly stimulating. On the other hand, if I&#x2019;d had one of those wives whose phones ring on and off all day long with calls from friends or co-workers, or whose nagging periodically leads to screaming rows with their husbands, I would have been grateful when she finally wore herself out.</p><p>The only respect in which my wife was at all unusual was that she didn&#x2019;t like wearing a bra. When I was a young man barely out of adolescence, and my wife and I were dating, I happened to put my hand on her back only to find that I couldn&#x2019;t feel a bra strap under her sweater, and when I realized what this meant I became quite aroused. In order to judge whether she might possibly have been trying to tell me something, I spent a minute or two looking at her through new eyes, studying her attitude. The outcome of my studies was that she wasn&#x2019;t, in fact, trying to send any kind of signal. So if not, was it laziness, or just a sheer lack of concern? I couldn&#x2019;t get my head round it. It wasn&#x2019;t even as though she had shapely breasts which might suit the &#x2018;no-bra look&#x2019;. I would have preferred her to go around wearing one that was thickly padded, so that I could save face in front of my acquaintances.</p><p>Even in the summer, when I managed to persuade her to wear one for a while, she&#x2019;d have it unhooked barely a minute after leaving the house. The undone hook would be clearly visible under her thin, light-coloured tops, but she wasn&#x2019;t remotely concerned. I tried reproaching her, lecturing her to layer up with a vest instead of a bra in that sultry heat. She tried to justify herself by saying that she couldn&#x2019;t stand wearing a bra because of the way it squeezed her breasts, and that I&#x2019;d never worn one myself so I couldn&#x2019;t understand how constricting it felt. Nevertheless, considering I knew for a fact that there were plenty of other women who, unlike her, didn&#x2019;t have anything particularly against bras, I began to have doubts about this hypersensitivity of hers.</p><p>In all other respects, the course of our our married life ran smoothly. We were approaching the five-year mark, and since we were never madly in love to begin with we were able to avoid falling into that stage of weariness and boredom that can otherwise turn married life into a trial. The only thing was, because we&#x2019;d decided to put off trying for children until we&#x2019;d managed to secure a place of our own, which had only happened last autumn, I sometimes wondered whether I would ever get to hear the reassuring sound of a child gurgling &#x2018;dada&#x2019;, and meaning me. Until a certain day last February, when I came across my wife standing in the kitchen at day-break in just her nightclothes, I had never considered the possibility that our life together might undergo such an appalling change.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2018;What are you doing standing there?&#x2019;</p><p>I&#x2019;d been about to switch on the bathroom light when I was brought up short. It was around four in the morning, and I&#x2019;d woken up with a raging thirst from the bottle and a half of soju I&#x2019;d had with dinner, which also meant I was taking longer to come to my senses than usual.</p><p>&#x2018;Hello? I asked what you&#x2019;re doing?&#x2019;</p><p>It was cold enough as it was, but the sight of my wife was even more chilling. Any lingering alcohol-induced drowsiness swiftly passed. She was standing, motionless, in front of the fridge. Her face was submerged in the darkness so I couldn&#x2019;t make out her expression, but the potential options all filled me with fear. Her thick, naturally black hair was fluffed up, dishevelled, and she was wearing her usual white ankle-length nightdress.</p><p>On such a night, my wife would ordinarily have hurriedly slipped on a cardigan and searched for her towelling slippers. How long might she have been standing there like that &#x2013; barefoot, in thin summer nightwear, ramrod straight as though perfectly oblivious to my repeated interrogation? Her face was turned away from me, and she was standing there so unnaturally still it was almost as if she were some kind of ghost, silently standing its ground.</p><p>What was going on? If she couldn&#x2019;t hear me then perhaps that meant she was sleepwalking.</p><p>I went towards her, craning my neck to try and get a look at her face.</p><p>&#x2018;Why are you standing there like that? What&#x2019;s going on . . .&#x2019;</p><p>When I put my hand on her shoulder I was surprised by her complete lack of reaction. I had no doubt that I was in my right mind and all this was really happening; I had been fully conscious of everything I had done since emerging from the living room, asking her what she was doing, and moving towards her. She was the one standing there completely unresponsive, as though lost in her own world. It was like those rare occasions when, absorbed in a late-night TV drama, she&#x2019;d failed to notice me arriving home. But what could there be to absorb her attention in the pale gleam of the fridge&#x2019;s white door, in the pitch-black kitchen at four in the morning?</p><p>&#x2018;Hey!&#x2019;</p><p>Her profile swam towards me out of the darkness. I took in her eyes, bright but not feverish, as her lips slowly parted.</p><p>&#x2018;. . . I had a dream.&#x2019;</p><p>Her voice was surprisingly clear.</p><p>&#x2018;A dream? What the hell are you talking about? Do you know what time it is?&#x2019;</p><p>She turned so that her body was facing me, then slowly walked off through the open door into the living room. As she entered the room she stretched out her foot and calmly pushed the door to. I was left alone in the dark kitchen, looking helplessly on as her retreating figure was swallowed up through the door.</p><p>I turned on the bathroom light and went in. The cold snap had continued for several days now, consistently hovering around -10�C. I&#x2019;d showered only a few hours ago, so my plastic shower slippers were still cold and damp. The loneliness of this cruel season began to make itself felt, seeping from the black opening of the ventilation fan above the bath, leaching out of the white tiles covering the floor and walls.</p><p>When I went back into the living room my wife was lying down, her legs curled up to her chest, the silence so weighted I might as well have been alone in the room. Of course, this was just my fancy. If I stood perfectly still, held my breath and strained to listen, I was able to hear the faintest sound of breathing coming from where she lay. Yet it didn&#x2019;t sound like the deep, regular breathing of someone who has fallen asleep. I could have reached out to her, and my hand would have encountered her warm skin. But for some reason I found myself unable to touch her. I didn&#x2019;t even want to reach out to her with words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the few moments immediately after I opened my eyes the next morning, when reality had yet to assume its usual concreteness, I lay with the quilt wrapped about me, absent-mindedly assessing the quality of the winter sunshine as it filtered into the room through the white curtain. In the middle of this fit of abstraction I happened to glance at the wall clock and jumped up the instant I saw the time, kicked the door open and hurried out of the room. My wife was in front of the fridge.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you crazy? Why didn&#x2019;t you wake me up? What time is . . .&#x2019;</p><p>Something squashed under my foot, stopping me in mid-sentence. I couldn&#x2019;t believe my eyes.</p><p>She was crouching, still wearing her nightclothes, her dishevelled, tangled hair a shapeless mass around her face. Around her, the kitchen floor was covered with plastic bags and airtight containers, scattered all over so that there was nowhere I could put my feet without treading on them. Beef for shabu-shabu, belly pork, two sides of black beef shin, some squid in a vacuum-packed bag, sliced eel that my mother-in-law had sent us from the countryside ages ago, dried croaker tied with yellow string, unopened packs of frozen dumplings and endless bundles of unidentified stuff dragged from the depths of the fridge. There was a rustling sound; my wife was busy putting the things around her one by one into black rubbish bags. Eventually I lost control.</p><p>&#x2018;What the hell are you up to now?&#x2019; I shouted.</p><p>She kept on putting the parcels of meat into the rubbish bags, seemingly no more aware of my existence than she had been last night. Beef and pork, pieces of chicken, at least 200,000-won worth of saltwater eel.</p><p>&#x2018;Have you lost your mind? Why on earth are you throwing all this stuff out?&#x2019;</p><p>I hurriedly stumbled my way through the plastic bags and grabbed her wrist, trying to prise the bags from her grip. Stunned to find her fiercely tugging back against me, I almost faltered for a moment, but my outrage soon gave me the strength to overpower her. Massaging her reddened wrist, she spoke in the same ordinary, calm tone of voice she&#x2019;d used before.</p><p>&#x2018;I had a dream.&#x2019;</p><p>Those words again. Her expression as she looked at me was perfectly composed. Just then my mobile rang.</p><p>&#x2018;Damn it!&#x2019;</p><p>I started to fumble through the pockets of my coat, which I&#x2019;d tossed onto the living room sofa the previous evening. Finally, in the last inside pocket, my fingers closed around my recalcitrant phone.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry. Something&#x2019;s come up, an urgent family matter, so . . . I&#x2019;m very sorry. I&#x2019;ll be there as quickly as possible. No, I&#x2019;m going to leave right now. It&#x2019;s just . . . no, I couldn&#x2019;t possibly have you do that. Please wait just a little longer. I&#x2019;m very sorry. Yes, I really can&#x2019;t talk right now . . .&#x2019;</p><p>I flipped my phone shut and dashed into the bathroom, where I shaved so hurriedly that I cut myself in two places.</p><p>&#x2018;Haven&#x2019;t you even ironed my white shirt?&#x2019;</p><p>There was no answer. I splashed water on myself and rummaged in the laundry basket, searching for yesterday&#x2019;s shirt. Luckily it wasn&#x2019;t too creased. Not once did my wife bother to peer out from the kitchen in the time it took me to get ready, slinging my tie round my neck like a scarf, pulling on my socks, and getting my notebook and wallet together. In the five years we&#x2019;d been married this was the first time I&#x2019;d had to go to work without her handing me my things and seeing me off.</p><p>&#x2018;You&#x2019;re insane! You&#x2019;ve completely lost it.&#x2019;</p><p>I crammed my feet into my recently purchased shoes, which were too narrow and pinched uncomfortably, threw open the front door and ran out. I checked whether the lift was going to go all the way up to the top floor, and then dashed down three flights of stairs. Only once I&#x2019;d managed to jump on the underground train as it was just about to leave did I have time to take in my appearance, reflected in the dark carriage window. I ran my fingers through my hair, did up my tie, and attempted to smooth out the creases in my shirt. My wife&#x2019;s unnaturally serene face, her incongruously firm voice, surfaced in my mind.</p><p><i>I had a dream </i>&#x2013; she&#x2019;d said that twice now. Beyond the window, in the dark tunnel, her face flitted by &#x2013; her face, but unfamiliar, as though I was seeing it for the first time. However, as I had thirty minutes in which to concoct an excuse for my client that would justify my lateness, as well as putting together a draft proposal for today&#x2019;s meeting, there was no time for mulling over the strange behaviour of my even-stranger wife. Having said that, I told myself that somehow or other I had to leave the office early today (never mind that in the several months since I&#x2019;d switched to my new position there hadn&#x2019;t been a single day where I&#x2019;d got off before midnight), and steeled myself for a confrontation.</p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Dark woods.

He has earned countless honors including a record seven Spur Awards from Western Writers of America, Inc., an organization that has voted Kelton the greatest Western Writer of all time. He lives in San Angelo, Texas.Chapter 1<br>His boots sinking deeply into the freshly turned earth, Andrew Lewis reached the end of the row and hollered, &#x201c;Whoa,&#x201d; at the big blue ox. The muscular old work animal sometimes required a fair amount of coaxing to start pulling the wooden plow, but the slightest hint would bring him to a stop. Balancing the plow handle against his leg, Andrew took off his floppy, sweat-stained hat and rubbed the sleeve of a homespun cotton shirt across his forehead. Spring had brought the heat early, he thought. He had never completely become used to the fact that spring came earlier here in Texas than it did back in Tennessee.<br>He looked around for the black dog that had spent much of the morning trotting alongside the plow, watching for mice or rabbits that occasionally popped up, startled. He thought the dog might be off seeking mischief, a trait at which it was discouragingly talented, but he saw it dozing in the shade of a rail fence that kept cattle out of the field. Were the dog not an eager protector of the children, Andrew would long since have tried to give it to some passing stranger.<br>As he had done regularly for most of a month, he let his gaze run expectantly over the trail that came westward from the town of San Felipe de Austin. Damn it, he chided himself, it&#x2019;s still a way too early to be looking for them. They&#x2019;re probably not halfway here yet from the old state.<br>His back ached from the hard labor of planting. He stretched, placing both hands above his waist and pushing, trying to straighten out the kink that seemed to have found itself a permanent home. Late rains had delayed his starting, and it was high time the corn seed was in the ground. Plant it too early and it was likely to freeze. Plant it too late and it might be caught by a long summer dry spell. Farming had never been an easy life anywhere, but it seemed sometimes that Texas weather had a special grudge against the plowman.<br>He turned slowly, looking across the expanse of land he claimed for his own. At twenty-eight, he already owned more hectares here in Mexican Texas than the acres he might reasonably have expected to put together in a long lifetime back in Tennessee. The government in Mexico had been generous to its American settlers and he felt grateful. He had done well, especially in the four years since he had married Petra Moreno. She had given him a reason to work, to build, to grow.<br>He looked across the field toward his log cabin, where smoke curled from the tall stone chimney. It promised him a good dinner later, when the sun rose to midday and his shadow lay close to his feet. He had lived in that cabin alone his first several years here. He had added a second section after his marriage to Petra. He saw her now, a distant, slender silhouette, standing in the open dog-run that divided the two sections of the cabin. She probably wondered if something was wrong that he had stopped the ox and the plow.<br>He had better start moving soon or she would come striding down to the field to be sure he was not sick or hurt. He waved to let her know he was all right. He did not like the idea of her leaving the two young ones at the cabin alone for even that long. Texas was benevolent in many ways, but it harbored special hazards for children: rattlesnakes, coral snakes, scorpions, and centipedes. There were bears and mountain lions as well, but they seldom ventured too close anymore. The ever-growing numbers of new immigrants into Stephen F. Austin&#x2019;s American colony had pushed those sorts of predators back farther and farther to the west. The ax and the plow were doing to them what the rifle alone probably never could.<br>&#x201c;Come on, Blue,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve lazed long enough.&#x201d;<br>He had no more than raised up the heavy-handled plow than the dog barked, and he eased it down again. Two riders approached from the direction of his older brother Michael&#x2019;s farm. Andrew smiled at the sight of eight-year-old Mordecai Lewis, carrying a rifle across his saddle longer than the boy was tall. Little Mordecai was making a start toward becoming the spitting image of his lanky father, who sat on the other horse.<br>Andrew called, &#x201c;Where you-all goin&#x2019; with all that artillery? You already got your corn plantin&#x2019; done?&#x201d;<br>He knew they could not have, for it had rained on Michael&#x2019;s place as much as on Andrew&#x2019;s.<br>The gaunt Michael pointed his chin westward, toward the heavy forests that lay along the river and beyond, where no one had yet settled. That land was being saved for other Lewis kin. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re gettin&#x2019; almighty tired of eatin&#x2019; hog. We&#x2019;re fixin&#x2019; to see if we can scare up some venison.&#x201d;<br>Mordecai put in eagerly, &#x201c;Or maybe even bear.&#x201d;<br>It was like Michael to leave the planting unfinished and go traipsing off into the woods, forgetting everything but the hunt. Andrew was glad Michael was taking little Mordecai, for the boy would give him reason to come home in a timely manner. Alone, Michael sometimes would stay out for days, even weeks, roaming, searching for God knew what, listening to calling voices that Andrew had never heard. Chances were that little Mordecai would turn out just like him. He ought to be in school, but no schooling was to be had out here so far from San Felipe except that which his mother gave him from her small collection of books and his father gave him in the field and the woods.<br>Somehow the work seemed to get done in spite of Michael&#x2019;s restlessness. Nobody had ever gone hungry in Michael Lewis&#x2019;s cabin. But Michael would never be as much a farmer as Andrew, and Andrew would never be the natural woodsman that Michael was.<br>The black dog sniffed around the horses&#x2019; heels until Michael&#x2019;s horse lifted a foot to kick at it. The dog retreated hastily to the rail fence and barked from a safe distance.<br>Andrew asked, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Marie and the young&#x2019;uns?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re fine. Marie said she might come over this evenin&#x2019; and set a spell with Petra. Ain&#x2019;t likely that me and Mordecai will be back before dark.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Petra&#x2019;ll be tickled to have her,&#x201d; Andrew said. Marie was French and Spanish, out of the old Louisiana town of Natchitoches. She usually fetched along samples of her cooking when she came visiting. It differed in some ways from Petra&#x2019;s East Texas Mexican. And both women had learned a lot of American dishes. Between the two of them there was always something good to eat.<br>He said, &#x201c;If you can take the time, I&#x2019;ll walk up to the cabin with you and drink a little of Petra&#x2019;s coffee.&#x201d;<br>Michael shook his head, as Andrew had expected he would. When he was headed for the woods, Michael had little interest in anything else. &#x201c;I expect we&#x2019;ll be gettin&#x2019; on. Mornin&#x2019;s half spent already.&#x201d; He looked eastward. &#x201c;You ain&#x2019;t seen any sign of them, have you?&#x201d;<br>Though he had done the same thing just a few minutes ago, Andrew said, &#x201c;No use wastin&#x2019; your time lookin&#x2019;. We can&#x2019;t even know for sure that they&#x2019;ve left Tennessee yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ve left,&#x201d; Michael said confidently. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re kin of ours, so they&#x2019;d&#x2019;ve been itchin&#x2019; to leave as soon as the snow melted. They&#x2019;re apt to come rollin&#x2019; in just about any day now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe. But they might run into trouble along the way.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ain&#x2019;t no trouble ever stopped a Lewis when his mind was set. And mine&#x2019;s set on a little huntin&#x2019;.&#x201d; He turned to his son. &#x201c;You ready, Mordecai?&#x201d;<br>The boy nodded enthusiastically. He carried his late grandfather&#x2019;s given name and already had much of his grandfather&#x2019;s look. There was an old family story that when the first Mordecai Lewis had been six months old he had crawled out of his crib and taken hold of a rifle. It was certain that from the time he became big enough to carry one, a rifle was never far from his reach. Mordecai, the father of Andrew and Michael, had been the first Lewis to come west into Texas, back before 1816. It had been Spanish then, and Americans were unwelcome. Fatally unwelcome. Mordecai died in Texas, a Spanish officer&#x2019;s bullet in his brain.<br>Much had happened in Texas in the fourteen years since; it was a different country now. Mexico had shaken off the Spanish imperial yoke, winning its independence on the battlefield, much as the United States had won its freedom from England. In an effort to settle Texas and put a buffer between itself and hostile Indian tribes, Mexico had welcomed Stephen F. Austin and other impresarios who brought American colonists into the thinly-populated land. She had granted them freedoms she did not allow even her own people down in the interior of Mexico. She had been generous with her lands to those who would live on them and make them fruitful.<br>It had been a mercurial, often-changing government, however. From the beginning, there had been those in the Mexican hierarchy who counseled for caution. There had been those who declared Americans to be an acquisitive and grasping people, unworthy of trust. They said that when Americans became too numerous, they were likely to want more and more land, until at last they took it all. Stephen Austin had often felt compelled to travel the long, hard road to Mexico City to plead the colonists&#x2019; case, to pledge their loyalty, and to vouch for their gratitude.<br>There had been worrisome stirrings. Back in 1825, Andrew and Michael had helped Austin and Mexican troops put down a short-lived, overblown rebellion by certain land seekers at Nacogdoches, who had declared themselves the independent republic of Fredonia. Many would have considered it laughable in its pretensions and its futility, but lawmakers in Mexico City had not laughed. Those who distrusted Americans had pointed to it as an ominous forerunner of things to come.<br>Life had remained peaceful here on the Colorado River west of San Felipe, headquarters of Austin&#x2019;s colony. Seldom did Andrew think about the Fredonian rebellion anymore. His mind and his efforts were directed toward developing his farm, enlarging his fields, increasing his little bunch of meat hogs running free in the woods, and expanding his modest herd of cattle. Lately he had been thinking about other Lewises, his kin, on their way here from Tennessee. They would find Texas different from the settled land of their birth. It was big and mostly undeveloped, a wilderness except for scattered clusters of settlements. They would probably think his Mexican wife Petra talked funny, as did Michael&#x2019;s wife Marie. But they would come to love both women when they got to know them. They would come to love this land as Andrew and Michael had learned to love it. Once they knew Texas, they would never want to leave.<br>After a time he heard Petra clanging a piece of iron against a broken section of wagon tire hanging in the dog-run. It was her signal for him to come to the cabin for dinner. The black dog jumped to its feet and made a start toward the house, then stopped and looked back expectantly. Andrew glanced up at the noon sun for confirmation, then unhooked the plow and left it standing in the row while he walked the blue ox down to the river for a good watering. When the animal drank its fill, Andrew took him to a pen to feed upon last summer&#x2019;s grass hay until it was time to go back to the field. The dog paced impatiently back and forth until Andrew said, &#x201c;Go on.&#x201d; The dog left him and trotted toward the cabin, willfully scattering the multicolored chickens that Petra treasured above all except family and cabin.<br>Petra waited in the dog-run and uptilted her chin for Andrew to kiss her. More than four years of marriage had not diminished that welcome ritual. She looked at him with eyes big and black and happy. &#x201c;You are hungry?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I could eat the south end of a mule.&#x201d;<br>She laughed. &#x201c;Today we eat pork instead.&#x201d; She had learned a fair amount of English, though she sometimes used the wrong word, put it in the wrong place, or mispronounced it. His Spanish fell short of perfect, so he could not fault her English. What mattered was that they understood each other in either language. Everybody else would just have to make the best of it.<br>He kissed her again, because he felt like it, and gave her a fierce squeeze. She laughed and said in Spanish, which came easier, &#x201c;This is not the time. This is the middle of day.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll feel the same way come night.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then wait for the night. The children are hungry.&#x201d;<br>Their oldest, three-going-on-four, played in the dog-run with a pup Michael had brought him. The boy was named Ben, after Andrew and Michael&#x2019;s Uncle Benjamin back in Tennessee. In the kitchen was the youngest, a girl, Rose to Andrew, Rosa to Petra. She sat in the high chair Andrew had first built for Ben and munched on a piece of flat bread, freshly baked on the hearth. Her eyes lighted at sight of her father, and she gave him a wet kiss, well flavored with the bread. Andrew felt fortunate that both children were healthy; that this isolated life could be hard on the little ones was painfully evidenced by a small grave above Michael and Marie&#x2019;s cabin.<br>Petra said, &#x201c;I saw Michael and Mordecai. Why did they not come to the house?&#x201d;<br>Andrew explained their mission. Petra smiled at the news that Marie would be coming over in the evening. Though the two women lived hardly two miles apart, they had not seen one another in a week or more. Each had her own work to do, work enough to last from daylight until well after dark. Life in frontier Texas granted women even less leisure than the men.<br>The field labor had made Andrew hungrier than he realized. He ate a considerable helping of pork and finished the meal by using some of the flat bread to swab up cane molasses he had traded from a farmer down near San Felipe.<br>The black dog sat in the doorway, forbidden to enter the cabin, though the pup was allowed. The dog had perfected a silent but plaintive form of begging. It usually worked better with Petra than with Andrew, who knew the dog had already made a good meal from a cottontail rabbit it had caught in the field.<br>The dog started barking and left its post at the door. Andrew glanced questioningly at Petra. It was too early for Michael to have returned, but travelers on the dim road between San Felipe and San Antonio de Bexar often stopped at Andrew and Petra&#x2019;s cabin. Andrew pushed back from the table and walked out on the dog-run, ready to invite a visitor to come in to the table.<br>He stopped short, the invitation stuck in his throat. An old animosity flared. He tried to suppress it and be civil to the two black-bearded men who sat on horseback in front of the cabin. He forced a semblance of a greeting. &#x201c;Howdy, Finis. Howdy, Luke.&#x201d;<br>One-armed Finis Blackwood seemed fatter every time Andrew saw him. It was no surprise, because his greatest exertion was in rushing to the dinner table. He said, &#x201c;Good day to you, Andrew. See you been busy plowin&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br>Luke echoed, &#x201c;Been plowin&#x2019;.&#x201d; Luke, broad and muscular, had always been a little slow in his thinking. Mostly he did whatever his older brother told him to, and took as gospel anything Finis said. For whatever he had been shorted in brains, Luke made up in meanness. Finis sicced him onto his enemies the way he would sic a dog. There had been a time Andrew would have met them with a rifle, but that was futile. When the Blackwoods looked for trouble, they never came in the open, as now. They sneaked in from behind when nobody was looking. That had been their style when they and the Lewises had grown up as reluctant neighbors back in Tennessee. It was still their way.</p><h2>The Way of the Oracle: Recovering the Practices of the Past to Find Answers for Today</h2><p><p>Throughout history, the uncertainties of life have driven people to seek counsel from prophets, seers, and oracles on everything from love to livelihood: people want to talk to their lost loved ones, heal old family traumas, find out about work, and determine what the future will bring.</p><p>In <i>The Way of the Oracle</i>, bestselling author, scholar, and priestess Diana L.

Paxson also presents a vast body of experience exploring this mysterious process. I worked as a seer with Paxson's Nordic seith group, her primary cultural focus. But I am also an academic folklorist, and an objective observer, and I am impressed with how she has used original sources, a deceptively simple method (trance and guided meditation), and her own lyrical poetry to weave a portal to another world where both the seer and seeker can discover knowledge to untangle the ordinary problems which confront us all.

From that day forward, the Bush administration turned to the Department of Justice to give its imprimatur to activities that had previously been unthinkable&#x2014;from the NSA&#x2019;s spying on US citizens to indefinite detention to torture. Many of these activities were secretly authorized, others done in the light of day.<br><br>When President Obama took office, many observers expected a reversal of these encroachments upon civil liberties and justice, but the new administration found the rogue policies to be deeply entrenched and, at times, worth preserving.

He never made it to the event. As soon as the jet landed, a black-�clad SWAT team surrounded it and hovered, weapons at the ready, as the plane was refueled and prepared for the return journey to Washington, DC. He made it out just in time&#x2014;�air travel in the United States would soon be suspended&#x2014;�and joined other top government officials at the White House early the next morning to meet with President George W. Bush, who had returned from his own Library Day event in Florida.<br><br>Ashcroft was seated between CIA director George Tenet and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. He could feel the president&#x2019;s eyes on him. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ever let this happen again,&#x201d; Bush said.<br><br>&#x201c;I took it personally,&#x201d; Ashcroft later wrote. &#x201c;From that moment forward, I devoted myself to an intense, sometimes secret war with a mission many people thought was impossible: stopping terrorists from striking again on American soil.&#x201d;<br><br>Although the president had been looking directly at him when he gave this command, Ashcroft wasn&#x2019;t entirely sure that it was intended for him. But regardless of whom Bush was holding accountable for the previous day&#x2019;s events, everyone in the room probably felt some version of Ashcroft&#x2019;s sense of responsibility and mission. The attack had caught them all off guard. They had failed in their duty to protect the country. Each of them now had to figure out what had gone wrong under his or her watch, how to correct it, and, above all, how to prevent a catastrophe like 9/11 from ever happening again.<br><br>Ashcroft&#x2019;s Justice Department, especially its storied law enforcement and investigative wing, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had a unique role in this reckoning. The FBI and the lawyers under Ashcroft&#x2019;s command would not only have to ferret out and round up those responsible for the attacks; they would also have to stop those who might be planning something similar. This was not a task for which Ashcroft was directly prepared, either by experience or by temperament. As a governor and a senator, he&#x2019;d focused on domestic issues, carving out a place for himself as a Christian conservative opposed to abortion, desegregation, and big government. As he had told Larry King in February 2001 during a discussion of gun control, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got enough laws on the books. I think what we need is tougher enforcement.&#x201d; It was enough for lawyers and investigators to step in after people had committed crimes, at which point, he said, &#x201c;we should nail them.&#x201d; Seven months after he talked to King, it was clear that this approach would not suffice when it came to terrorism.<br><br>When he returned to his office after the White House meeting, Ashcroft assembled his top deputies. They were being deployed in the war on terror, he told them. They would have to peer into the future and beyond the nation&#x2019;s borders in order to do their new job: keeping the country safe.<br>Robert Mueller&#x2019;s first full day on the job as FBI director was September 10, 2001. He hadn&#x2019;t even found the bathrooms in his new headquarters when the planes hit the buildings in New York and Washington. But he was plenty oriented to the job of combating terrorism&#x2014;�certainly more so than his boss. Princeton-�educated, worldly, a decorated Vietnam Marine veteran, and a prominent prosecutor, Mueller had told the Senate committee vetting his nomination to the FBI post in the summer of 2001 that &#x201c;the major threat that we have, and the threat that the Bureau needs to worry about the most, is terrorism.&#x201d;<br><br>Yet as Mueller recalled for a 2012 gathering of Harvard Business School students, one of his very first meetings with President Bush after 9/11 didn&#x2019;t go very well. He was in the Oval Office describing to Bush and Cheney his agents&#x2019; efforts to piece together an account of who the conspirators were, how they had carried out their attacks, and what their connection was to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, when Bush interrupted him: &#x201c;Stop it! What you&#x2019;re telling me the bureau is doing is what you&#x2019;ve been doing for a hundred years; my question for you today is what is the bureau doing today to prevent the next terrorist attack.&#x201d; The president, Mueller said, asked him that same question every day for the next four years.<br><br>What the bureau had been doing for a hundred years, or at least for the previous decade or so, clearly hadn&#x2019;t worked. As Ashcroft told Congress on September 25, the attacks revealed &#x201c;a total breakdown in our intelligence, one that cannot be excused and must never be forgotten.&#x201d; Mueller, Ashcroft, and others had immediately begun to investigate how the bureau had missed the signs that a terrorist attack was imminent. This wasn&#x2019;t the first time the FBI had had to investigate itself. Less than a year earlier, in February 2001, it had arrested one of its own agents, Robert Hanssen. Hanssen had been spying for the Russians for years without being caught. High-�profile failures like these had led investigators to ugly conclusions about the health of America&#x2019;s premier law enforcement agency. Internal communications were, as one report put it, rife with &#x201c;human error, compounded by antiquated and cumbersome information technology systems and procedures.&#x201d; There was no networked computer system for research and information sharing; field agents were reduced to consulting public libraries to obtain information. Relationships among the various sections of the agency were &#x201c;dysfunctional&#x201d; and &#x201c;broken,&#x201d; which led to repeated failures to communicate. The bureau was cripplingly short on able translators.<br><br>Sometimes the consequences of the disarray were only minor, if embarrassing. Ashcroft, for instance, was forced to postpone Timothy McVeigh&#x2019;s execution in the wake of a disclosure that the FBI had failed to provide evidence to McVeigh&#x2019;s defense team, a lapse that turned out to be the result of disorganization. But sometimes they were devastating, as in the case of Wen Ho Lee, a Los Alamos scientist suspected of transmitting nuclear secrets to China&#x2014;�&#x201c;allegations of espionage as significant as any the United States Government is likely to face,&#x201d; as the official report on the debacle put it. But, the report concluded, the &#x201c;FBI&#x2019;s . . . investigation of Wen Ho Lee, in virtually every material respect, was deeply and fundamentally flawed.&#x201d; The agency failed to make the Lee case a priority. It assigned an overworked, underexperienced agent to it and then denied him resources. Information got tangled up in bureaucratic webs. Supervisors ignored the case. In the meantime Lee, who had indisputably downloaded nuclear secrets onto a flash drive and who had been caught on wiretap promising a captured spy that he would find out who had turned him in, languished in solitary confinement for nine months, becoming a civil liberties cause c�l�bre. In the end, he pleaded guilty to just one of the fifty-�nine counts on which he had been indicted, then went on to write a book called My Country Versus Me, in which he argued that he had been a victim of racial profiling.<br><br>If the FBI&#x2019;s logistical and informational infrastructure was too dysfunctional to nail the bad guys, it certainly wasn&#x2019;t up to the task of finding out in advance who they were and what they were up to and then preventing them from committing crimes. Running an effective intelligence operation required competent data collection, skilled analysis, and timely exchange of massive amounts of information, and the FBI, by its own reckoning, had failed miserably at all three.<br><br>Turning the FBI around was a daunting task, but at least Mueller and Ashcroft got along, which is more than you could say for their predecessors, Louis Freeh and Janet Reno, whose mutual dislike erupted into open hostility in the aftermath of the Waco siege and shootout. And in Mueller, Ashcroft had a man who was motivated not only by a sense of duty and patriotism but by the kind of institutional loyalty that can make a person even more dedicated. The FBI&#x2019;s intelligence failures had initially led to proposals for a new agency dedicated to domestic intelligence, an idea that would gain steam in the years to come. In February 2003, for instance, Senator John Edwards (D-�NC) called for the creation of a Homeland Intelligence Agency to &#x201c;replace FBI units that failed to uncover the September 11 terrorists and still cannot find suspected al Qaeda operatives in the United States.&#x201d; A domestic intelligence agency was also on the 9/11 Commission&#x2019;s radar, and White House officials were considering it throughout the early post-�9/11 years. None of these proposals gained much traction, but Mueller took the fact that the subject was under discussion as a cue to put in motion several programs designed to maintain the FBI&#x2019;s hold on domestic intelligence. Mueller was successful, though the threat of domestic intelligence agencies would linger for several years. When the 9/11 Commission finally issued its report, it noted that its recommendation to keep domestic intelligence at the FBI was valid only if the bureau &#x201c;can do the job.&#x201d;<br><br>Mueller met these challenges by setting up new programs that would focus on intelligence collection both at home and abroad, with more resources, better technology, and an expansion of intelligence functions already in place. But some of the hurdles were not the result of internal disarray; nor could they be fixed directly by Mueller. They were the result of the suspicion of governmental power woven into the Constitution, and especially the Fourth Amendment&#x2019;s guarantee against searches and seizures. The framers had prevented the state from forcibly entering people&#x2019;s homes and sifting through their papers and effects&#x2014;�precisely the kind of power that a law enforcement agency bent on ferreting out &#x201c;evil�doers&#x201d; and stopping them might like to have. But Congress could pass laws that pushed against the boundaries of the Constitution and let the courts sort out whether they were permissible. That was just what Mueller needed, and for this he was dependent on his boss, who would have to persuade legislators to give the FBI more power to expand its intelligence capabilities.<br><br>Within two weeks of 9/11, Ashcroft had done exactly that. On September 25 he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee with a sobering message: &#x201c;I regret to inform you that we are today sending our troops into the modern field of battle with antique weapons.&#x201d; But there was good news, too, he said. In the two weeks since the attacks, the DOJ had assembled a twenty-�one-�page proposal for a so-�called Anti-�Terrorism Plan that would provide &#x201c;new tools to fight terrorism.&#x201d; The bill was called the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001&#x2014;�a title whose first letters spelled out USA PATRIOT. The acronym was awkward, to say the least, but as Ashcroft explained, it described &#x201c;the true nature of the battle&#x201d;: stop terrorism before it could start. The name was also excellent public relations; it was impossible to imagine anyone but a traitor objecting to a patriot act.<br><br>The act amended 108 preexisting criminal justice statutes and created nine new ones, changes designed to equip the country&#x2019;s law enforcement agencies with new weapons to fight the intelligence battles of the war on terror. Agents could now search telephone and email records, get access to individual and corporate financial data, and search homes and businesses&#x2014;�all expanded powers that reduced the protections of the Fourth Amendment. Some activities, such as wiretapping, still required court orders, but the act made those orders much easier to obtain. It also allowed for the indefinite detention of immigrants suspected of having ties to terrorist groups&#x2014;�not only to prevent them from committing violence but also to make them available for interrogation. In short, the Patriot Act privileged intelligence collection over constitutional protections.<br><br>In case members of Congress objected to this turnabout, Ashcroft was ready with some explanations. The new approach to search and detention was necessary, he told them, because &#x201c;our fight against terrorism is not merely or primarily a criminal justice endeavor. It is a defense of our nation and its citizens.&#x201d; In sum, Ashcroft explained, &#x201c;We cannot wait for terrorists to strike to begin investigations and to take action. The death tolls are too high, the consequences too great.&#x201d; This approach would not suffice when it came to terrorism, he continued: &#x201c;We must prevent first, prosecute second.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; he assured lawmakers, the FBI and other law enforcement officials would exercise their new powers with &#x201c;careful regard for the constitutional rights of Americans and respect for all human beings.&#x201d; Ashcroft did not say exactly how he intended to square that restraint with warrantless searches of Americans and indefinite detention of foreigners held in custody without access to the federal courts. But then again, he didn&#x2019;t really have to. The country was still in a state of panic, and questioning the need for strong action seemed na�ve at best and dangerous at worst. Only one senator, Russ Feingold (D-�WI), and sixty-�six representatives voted against the bill, and on October 23 the Patriot Act, the most significant reshaping of Americans&#x2019; relationship to the power of their government at least since the Alien Act of 1918 (or perhaps ever), became the law of the land. Suspicion of governmental power&#x2014;�a tendency of many conservatives&#x2014;�had given way to a hope that a powerful government could keep the country safe by preventing future attacks.<br><br>Of all the provisions of the Patriot Act, a section that would make it easier for intelligence and law enforcement agents to talk to one another was of particular significance to the top officials of the Justice Department&#x2014;�especially Michael Chertoff, the head of its Criminal Division. Chertoff, a former federal prosecutor under US Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, was the senior on-�duty official from Main Justice&#x2014;�the Justice Department&#x2019;s headquarters&#x2014;�working at FBI headquarters on the morning of 9/11. He spent the following days poring over files, trying to figure out how such a large operation had escaped notice. He came across one file that was so disturbing that he sprang from his chair and rushed into Ashcroft&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;John,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you won&#x2019;t believe this.&#x201d;<br><br>Chertoff handed his boss a memo&#x2014;�a report from an FBI agent who had written, &#x201c;This is a guy who could fly an airplane into the World Trade Center.&#x201d; The guy in question was Zacarias Mous�saoui, a thirty-�three-�year-�old French citizen of Moroccan descent. In early August 2001, Mous�saoui had shown up at the Pan Am International Flight Academy in a suburb of Minneapolis, seeking time on the school&#x2019;s 747 simulator. Clarence Prevost, the flight instructor who first brought suspicions about Mous�saoui to the FBI&#x2019;s attention, said that it wasn&#x2019;t only the hundred-�dollar bills Moussaoui used to pay the $8,300 training fee that got his attention; it was also the fact that despite the fifty or so hours he&#x2019;d spent on lessons in a single-�engine plane, Mous�saoui had failed to get a pilot&#x2019;s license; that once seated at the simulator, he clearly had no idea what he was doing; and that when Prevost asked him if he was Muslim, the otherwise genial student flared up and yelled, &#x201c;I am nothing!&#x201d;<br><br>Prevost, a retired commercial pilot, alerted his bosses. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know anything about this guy,&#x201d; he told them, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;re teaching him how to throw the switches on a 747.&#x201d; At first, they dismissed Prevost&#x2019;s concerns and reminded him that Mous�saoui was a paying customer.

The backdrop of the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast is a versatile setting for Burke&#x2019;s stories, which cover the scope of the human experience&#x2014;from love and sex to domestic abuse to war, death, and friendship.</p><p>James Lee Burke is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, two-time winner of the Edgar Award, and the recipient of the Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Arts in Fiction. A legend of the mystery genre, he's authored thirty-two novels and two short story collections including <i>Robicheaux</i>, <i>Light of the World</i>,&nbsp;<i>Creole Belle</i>, <i>Swan Peak</i>, <i>The Tin Roof Blowdown</i>, and <i>Feast Day of Fools</i>.&nbsp;He lives in Misoula, Montana.Burke's celebrated Dave Robicheaux mystery series hinges on encounters between the powerless and the powerful; the powerless usually lose, of course, but at least they have New Iberia, Louisiana, policeman Robicheaux to fight some of their battles for them. The 11 stories in this collection of Burke's short fiction also dramatize what happens when poor people are trapped in the vice of circumstances beyond their control, but here there is no Robicheaux to come to their aid. Although some of the stories concern individuals caught in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina--the ultimate circumstance beyond one's control--the majority are set in the past, usually rural Louisiana or Mississippi in the late 1940s. Whether the lead characters are abused children or prostitutes trying to escape the life, Burke always makes us see both the near certainty of tragedy to come and the smoldering embers of possibility in the ashes of blighted lives. He is both a deeply romantic and an unremittingly realistic writer, and it is in that tension that his lyrical prose takes flight: "But even in the middle of an Indian summer's day, when the sugarcane is beaten with purple and gold light in the fields, . . . I have to mourn just a moment for those people of years ago who lived lives they did not choose, who carried burdens that were not their own." <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He had just returned from a night&#x2019;s vigil on the mountain. He was resting on his bed, Bible open at the Book of Revelation, when two police constables, one tall, the other short, knocked at the door.</p><p>&#x2018;Are you Mr Munira?&#x2019; the short one asked. He had a star-shaped scar above the left brow.</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You teach at the New Ilmorog Primary School?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And where do you think you are now standing?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ah, yes.

He looked at his bandaged left hand. He had not been kept long at the hospital. He felt strangely calm after the night&#x2019;s ordeal. But he still could not understand what had really happened. Maybe in time, he thought &#x2013; but would he ever be able to explain this fulfilment of what had only been a wish, an intention? How far had he willed it?

He heard a knock at the door. He leapt out of bed in his pyjamas. He found a heavily armed police contingent at the door. An officer in khaki clothes stepped forward.</p><p>&#x2018;What is the matter?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;You are wanted at the police station.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What for?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Routine questioning.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t it wait until tomorrow?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I am afraid not.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Let me change into something . . .&#x2019;</p><p>He went back and changed. He wondered how he would contact the others. He had listened to the six o&#x2019;clock news and so he knew that the strike had been banned. But he hoped that even if he was arrested, the strike would go on.</p><p>He was hurled into a waiting Land Rover, and driven off.</p><p>Akinyi, preparing to go to Ilmorog Church for the morning service, happened to look in the direction of his house. She always did this, automatically, and she had promised herself to cut out the habit. She saw the Land Rover drive away. She rushed to his place &#x2013; she had never been there &#x2013; and found the door padlocked.</p><p>Within a few hours word had spread. The workers, in a hostile mood, marched toward the police station demanding his release. A police officer came out and spoke to them in a surprisingly conciliatory manner.</p><p>&#x2018;Please disband peacefully. Karega is here for routine questioning. And it is not about your last night&#x2019;s decision to take a strike action.

Out with exploitation of our sweat!&#x2019;</p><p>The crowd was getting into an angry, threatening mood. He signalled his lieutenants. They called out others who came with guns and chased the protesting workers right to the centre of Ilmorog. One or two workers sustained serious injuries and were taken to hospital.</p><p>Workers were waking to their own strength. Such a defiant confrontation with authority had never before happened in Ilmorog.</p><p>5 ~ One newspaper, the Daily Mouthpiece, brought out a special issue with a banner headline: MZIGO, CHUI, KIMERIA MURDERED.</p><p>A man, believed to be a trade-union agitator, has been held after a leading industrialist and two educationists, well known as the African directors of the internationally famous Theng&#x2019;eta Breweries and Enterprises Ltd, were last night burnt to death in Ilmorog, only hours after taking a no-nonsense-no-pay-rise decision.</p><p>It is believed that they were lured into a house where they were set on by hired thugs.</p><p>The three will be an irreplaceable loss to Ilmorog.

Kimeria and Chui were prominent and founding fathers of KCO . . . etc . . . etc . . .</p><p><b>Chapter Two</b></p><p>1 ~ But all that was twelve years after Godfrey Munira, a thin dustcloud trailing behind him, first rode a metal horse through Ilmorog to the door of a moss-grown two-roomed house in what was once a schoolyard. He got off and stood still, his right hand akimbo, his left holding the horse, his reddish lined eyes surveying the grey, dry lichen on a once white-ochred wall. Then, unhurriedly, he leaned the metal horse against the wall and, bending down, unclipped loose the trouser bottoms, beat them a little with his hands &#x2013; a symbolic gesture, since the dust stubbornly clung to them and to his shoes &#x2013; before moving back a few steps to re-survey the door, the falling-apart walls and the sun-rotted tin roof. Suddenly, determinedly, he strode to the door and tried the handle while pushing the door with his right shoulder. He crashed through into a room full of dead spiders and the wings of flies on cobwebs on all the walls, up to the eaves.</p><p>Another one has come into the village, went the news in Ilmorog. Children spied on him, on his frantic efforts to trim up and weed the place, and they reported everything to the old men and women. He would go away with the wind, said the elderly folk: had there not been others before him? Who would want to settle in this wasteland except those without limbs &#x2013; may the devil swallow Abdulla &#x2013; and those with aged loins &#x2013; may the Lord bless Nyakinyua, the old woman.</p><p>The school itself was a four-roomed barrack with broken mud walls, a tin roof with gaping holes and more spiders&#x2019; webs and the wings and heads of dead flies. Was it any wonder that teachers ran away at the first glance? The pupils were mostly shepherd boys, who often did not finish a term but followed their fathers in search of new pastures and water for their cattle.</p><p>But Munira stayed on, and after a month we were all whispering &#x2013; was he a little crazed &#x2013; and he not so old? Was he a carrier of evil? &#x2014; especially when he started holding classes under the acacia bush near the place rumoured to be the grave of the legendary Ndemi, whose spirit once kept watch over Ilmorog Country before imperialism came and changed the scheme of things. He is mocking Ndemi, said Mwathi wa Mugo, who divined for both the ridge and the plains and prescribed a deterrent. At night, under the cover of darkness, the old woman shat a mountain between the school building and the acacia bush. In the morning the children found a not-so-dry mound of shit. They ran back to their parents and told a funny story about the new teacher. For a week or so Munira galloped his horse the length of the hills and plains in pursuit of the disappearing pupils. He caught up with one. He got off his horse, letting it fall to the ground, and ran after the pupil.</p><p>&#x2018;What is your name?&#x2019; he asked, holding him by the shoulder.</p><p>&#x2018;Muriuki.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Son of?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Wambui.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s your mother?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What about your father?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He works far away.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Tell me: why don&#x2019;t you like school?&#x2019;</p><p>The boy was drawing marks on the ground with his right toe, head bent to one side, holding back laughter with difficulty.</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x2019; he said, making as if to cry. Munira let him go after getting a promise that Muriuki would return and even bring the others. So they came back cautiously: they still thought him a bit odd and this time would not venture out of the closed walls.</p><p>She waited for Munira outside the school kei-apple hedge. He got off the metal horse. He stood aside, thinking she only wanted to pass. But she stood in the middle of the narrow track supporting herself against a twigged stick.</p><p>&#x2018;Where you come from: are there tarmac roads?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And light that comes from wires on dry trees to make day out of night?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Women in high heels?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oiled hair, singed goatskin smell?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;</p><p>He looked at her furrowed face, at the light in her eyes. His own wandered past her, over the empty school, for it was after four o&#x2019;clock, and he thought: what did she want?</p><p>&#x2018;They are beautiful and wise in the ways of the white man: is this not so?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That they are: too wise, sometimes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Our young men and women have left us. The glittering metal has called them. They go, and the young women only return now and then to deposit the newborn with their grandmothers already aged with scratching this earth for a morsel of life. They say: there in the city there is room for only one . . . our employers, they don&#x2019;t want babies about the tiny rooms in tiny yards. Have you ever heard of that? Unwanted children? The young men also. Some go and never return. Others sometimes come to see the wives they left behind, make them round-bellied, and quickly go away as if driven from Ilmorog by Uhere or Mutung&#x2019;u. What should we call them? The new Uhere and Mutung&#x2019;u generation: for was it not the same skin diseases and plagues that once in earlier times weakened our people in face of the Mzungu invasion? Tell me: what then brings you to a deserted homestead? Look at Abdulla. He came from over there and what did he bring us? A donkey. Now imagine, a donkey! What have you really come to fetch from our village? Is it the remaining children?&#x2019;</p><p>He pondered this a few seconds. He plucked a ripened yellow kei-apple and crushed it between his fingers: isn&#x2019;t there a safe corner in which to hide and do some work, plant a seed whose fruits one could see? The smell from the rotting fermenting kei-apple hit into his nostrils. He felt a sudden nausea, Lord deliver us from our past, and frantically fumbled in his pockets for a handkerchief to cover the sneeze. It was too late. A bit of mucus flew onto the woman&#x2019;s furrowed face. She shrieked out, auuu-u, Nduri ici mutiuke muone, and fled in fright. He turned his face aside to hold back another sneeze. When a second later he looked to the path, he could not find a trace of her behind the kei-apple bush or anywhere. She had vanished.</p><p>Strange, mysterious, he muttered to himself. He got on his metal horse and slowly rode toward Abdulla&#x2019;s shop.</p><p>Abdulla was also a newcomer to Ilmorog. He and little skinny Joseph had come into our midst in a donkey-cart full of an assortment of sufurias and plates and cheap blankets tightly packed into torn sisal sacks and dirty sheets knotted into temporary bags. This was going to be an eventful year, Njogu had exclaimed sarcastically on seeing the odd trio, and listening to their even more odd request: how in this desert place could anyone even think of rescuing the broken mud-walled shop that had once belonged to Dharamashah of Ilmorog legends? You can take the ghost . . . memories, curses and all . . . old Njogu had said, pointing to the building, whose roof and walls leaned to one side and looked indistinguishable from the dry weed and the red earth. We used to crowd his little shop and look curiously at his stumped leg and his miserable face and listen to his stream of curses at Joseph. Soon we were glad that at long last we had a place from which we could get salt and pepper. But we were rather alarmed at his donkey because it ate too much grass and drank too much water.

Drawing on remarkable new science, <i>Tinderbox</i> overturns the conventional wisdom on the origins of this deadly pandemic, and in a riveting narrative that stretches from colonial Leopoldville to 1980s San Francisco to South Africa today, it reveals how human hands unleashed this epidemic and can now overcome it, if only we learn the lessons of the past.</p><p><b>Craig Timberg</b> is the former Johannesburg bureau chief for the <i>Washington Post</i> and its deputy national security editor.

Shakespeare)</h2><p>The Duke of Illyria hosts a wedding party in his palace garden. But which fair maiden is destined to become his bride? This comedy of errors is filled with wit and laughs. Shakespeare&#39;s immortal dramas are now available in illustrated form for classroom use! This revolutionary way of introducing the timeless comedies and tragedies of the Bard of Avon combines the art form of the graphic novel with written passages taken directly from Shakespeare&#39;s texts. Children first studying Shakespeare are sometimes intimidated by the difficulty of his language. They will often miss the excitement and suspense in his story lines and the fascination of the wonderful characters he has created. Approaching his plays in the form of graphic-novel-style picture stories, supplemented with excerpts from the original dialogue, can be a young student&#39;s important first step in truly understanding and appreciating Shakespeare&#39;s masterpieces. Preceding the action of each play, these books offer brief summaries explaining what the play is all about, followed by illustrated casts of characters, each character shown with a brief descriptive caption. Supplementing each title in this series is a separately available teacher&#39;s guide that suggests topics for classroom discussion and advises on imaginative activities that fit the classroom environment and coincide with the five acts of each play.</p><p>[back cover]<br><b>Picture This!<br>Shakespeare </b><br>William Shakespeare&#x2019;s<br><b>Twelfth Night </b><br>The Duke of Illyria invites you to an afternoon party in the garden of his palace to celebrate the occasion of his marriage.<br>But who will be his bride?<br>Will it be the Countess?<br>Will it be the young girl rescued from the sea?<br>Follow this story of mistakes, disguises, and practical jokes to find out who will marry the Duke!<br><b>Picture This!

But they forget all about the tiniest, quietest creature on the farm&#x2015;the ladybug. She has a plan of her own. <br>Julia Donaldson turns her literary expertise to a farm setting, and comes up with a rollicking barnyard mystery. Lydia Monks' colorful collage illustrations go perfectly with the story for a winning combination. Readers will quack, neigh, moo, and cheer for the ladybug all the way through! <br><i>What the Ladybug Heard</i> is a 2011 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p>Julia Donaldson is the best-selling author of many books for children, including <i>One Ted Falls Out of Bed</i>, <i>The Gruffalo</i>, and <i>The Giants and the Joneses</i>. She lives in Scotland with her family.</p><p>Lydia Monks is an award-winning artist, and her brilliantly colored collage illustrations are featured in many popular picture books. She lives in Sheffield, England.</p>Parades of animals stream through these two titles -- one silly, the other sweet. Start the day with Julia Donaldson's bouncy ode to life on a noisy farm and to one special inhabitant who, unlike the other critters, "never said a word." Never, that is, until "two men in a big black van, / With a map and a key and a cunning plan" arrive to steal the "fine prize cow." That's when the smallest of all goes into action: " 'Help!' was the ladybug's very first word, / And 'Gather around' were the second and third." Flamboyant colors, zany perspectives and a neatly circular tale lead, with satisfying inevitability, to a happy outcome for all but the thieves. <br><br>End the day with A Sick Day for Amos McGee (Roaring Brook, $16.99; ages 3-5), by Philip C. Stead and illustrated by Erin E. Stead. A zookeeper by profession and an animal lover by nature, gentle, fastidious Amos McGee tends to much more than just his charges' health. He plays chess with the elephant ("who thought and thought before making a move"), runs races with the tortoise ("who never ever lost"), and spends quiet time with the penguin ("who was very shy"). In a tribute to the ineffable bond between keeper and kept, it is impossible to tell if the animals' expressions are a perfect mirror of Amos's or the other way around. And that is the crux of the story, for when Amos gets sick, it is the animals who take on the business of caring for their favorite human. Thick, creamy paper and a muted palette add to the gentle resonance of a story that ends with everyone tucked in at last for a sweet night's sleep. <br><br>Reviewed by Kristi Jemtegaard<br>Copyright 2010, The Washington Post.

Not Harold's idea of fun. Too many mosquitoes, ticks and cockleburs. But when the Monroe family set out, their faithful dog Harold was with them, mostly because he remembered that camping could also bring s'mores and toasted marshmallows. Howie, the other family dog, and Chester the cat were also included in the trip. Only Chester thought the idea was completely insane. The woods, he informed Harold, were not only full of cockleburs and ticks, but of spirits, evil spirits who prey on the innocent. And on this, the worst night of the year -- St. George's Eve, when all spirits are set loose -- who knew what could happen. <br>What Harold knew was that Chester was a well read, over-stimulated cat, full of weird ideas. He did not take Chester's worries too seriously. He had s'more to think about. But then, the Monroes set up camp near two strange men and their even stranger dog, and things began to happen that made even Harold wonder. Could Chester be right? <br>This begins a long night, full of terrors and alarms, full of Chester's horrifying tale of how Bunnicula, the vampire bunny, was born and came to America, full of storms and a total sense of danger; and at the end came surprises that even Chester could not have predicted. <br>Once again, the Monroe family may be the victims of evil forces or only of Chester's strange imagination. But whichever, the result is suspenseful and very, very funny.</p><p>hours<br>2 cassettes<br>Performance by Victor Garber<br><br>An overnight camping trip!

Then, when she and her friends proceed with their first lesson, they make the whole schoolhouse fly up over Witchville. In the end, the students save both the schoolhouse and Professor Zucchini, who had been turned into a blackboard by a mischievous ghost. Coombs's text is great fun for adults as well as children. "A teacher is someone who doesn't get headaches," declares Dorrie's exasperated Big Witch mother. Witch youngsters are frightened by the dark, spooky woods; Professor Zucchini is tranformed by the ghost that flunked; and Lesson One is a modern "Quick Start Broomstick Mix." Coombs further delights readers with the contrast of the brightly colored socks and spell-making chemicals against warm neutral backgrounds. A pink and yellow good-luck spell swirls out of the cauldron, bubble-bath style, inviting readers to discover all the pictures hidden in its shapes.

Two of the essays delve more deeply into the human drama and heroism of his interment in a Nazi prison camp at Buchenwald, which Lusseyran described so movingly in his autobiography <i>And There Was Light.</i> Others explore the mystery and wonder of the world that his remarkable inner vision revealed and offer a comparison of sight both with and without eyes.<br><br>Imagine experiencing senses far beyond the usual five &#x2014; true and vivid sight without eyes, sound from trees, pressure from inanimate objects. Imagine reading the words of a man whom many consider a modern day saint. <i>Against the Pollution of the I</i> possesses the ingredients that make for success: the heroism of World War II, clear-sighted hope, and a full-hearted love of life. Blindness, for Lusseyran, invited him to pay more attention, enabling him to discover the divinity of the world available to all people. And in this remarkable collection of essays, Lusseyran offers us a way to access our precious light-filled inner self &#x2014; our I &#x2014; and transform our lives!</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchFrom Homer to Borges, the Western canon is replete with blind poet-seers. In this luminous book, Lusseyran (1924-1971; And There Was Light) demonstrates once again his place among the illustrious sightless sages. Here, six biographical essays explore the mystical conjunction among the realms of literature, epistemology and phenomenology. Clear and insightful prose inspires the reader to look beyond the limitations of the senses, as Lusseyran speaks of an inner seeing, reminiscent of the finer works of Martin Buber and Viktor Frankl. Totally blind from the age of eight, Lusseyran went on to become a distinguished student, a leader of the French Resistance, a prisoner at Buchenwald and a distinguished academic. The related but free-standing essays here, appearing for the first time in book form, explore the nature of blindness and our attitude toward the blind; the liberating quality of poetry in the hell of the concentration camp; how, by personal example, a secular saint helped fellow inmates transcend the barbed wire of Buchenwald; the importance of the individual soul rising above the illusory limitations of time and place to unite with the ultimate source of purpose and meaning in the universe. The clarity of the writing, and the force of both grim and exalted experience behind the words, carry an extraordinary authority and wisdom.

A young boy is taken to Edinburgh&#x2019;s Castle Rock, where his father assures him that on a clear day he can see America, and he catches a glimpse of his father&#x2019;s dream. In stories that follow, as the dream becomes a reality, two sisters-in-law experience very different kinds of passion on the long voyage to the New World; a baby is lost and magically reappears on a journey from an Illinois homestead to the Canadian border. <br><br>Other stories take place in more familiar Munro territory, the towns and countryside around Lake Huron, where the past shows through the present like the traces of a glacier on the landscape and strong emotions stir just beneath the surface of ordinary comings and goings. First love flowers under the apple tree, while a stronger emotion presents itself in the barn. A girl hired as summer help, and uneasy about her &#x201c;place&#x201d; in the fancy resort world she&#x2019;s come to, is transformed by her employer&#x2019;s perceptive parting gift. A father whose early expectations of success at fox farming have been dashed finds strange comfort in a routine night job at an iron foundry. A clever girl escapes to college and marriage. <br><br>Evocative, gripping, sexy, unexpected&#x2014;these stories reflect a depth and richness of experience. <i>The View from Castle Rock </i>is a brilliant achievement from one of the finest writers of our time.</p><p><b>Alice Munro </b>grew up in Wingham, Ontario, and attended the University of Western Ontario. She has published eleven new collections of stories&#x2014;<i>Dance of the Happy Shades</i>; <i>Something I&#x2019;ve Been Meaning to Tell You; The Beggar Maid; The Moons of Jupiter; The Progress of Love; Friend of My Youth; Open Secrets; The Love of a Good Woman; </i> <i>Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage</i>; <i>Runaway</i>; and a volume of <i>Selected Stories</i>&#x2014;as well as a novel, <i>Lives of Girls and Women. </i> During her distinguished career she has been the recipient of many awards and prizes, including three of Canada&#x2019;s Governor General&#x2019;s Literary Awards and two of its Giller Prizes, the Rea Award for the Short Story, the Lannan Literary Award, England&#x2019;s W.

Upon the hills the soil is in many places mossy and fit for nothing. The air in general is moist. This is occasioned by the height of the hills which continually attract the clouds and the vapour that is continually exhaled from the mossy ground . . . The nearest market town is fifteen miles away and the roads so deep as to be almost impassable. The snow also at times is a great inconvenience, often for many months we can have no intercourse with mankind. And a great disadvantage is the want of bridges so that the traveller is obstructed when the waters are swelled . . . Barley oats and potatoes are the only crops raised. Wheat rye turnips and cabbage are never attempted . . .</i><br><br><i>There are ten proprietors of land in this parish: none of them resides in it.</i><br><br><i>Contribution by the Minister of Ettrick Parish, in the county of Selkirk, to the Statistical Account of Scotland, 1799</i><br>The Ettrick Valley lies about fifty miles due south of Edinburgh, and thirty or so miles north of the English border, which runs close to the wall Hadrian built to keep out the wild people from the north. The Romans pushed farther, and built some sort of fortifications called Antonine's Wall between the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth, but those did not last long. The land between the two walls has been occupied for a long time by a mix of people&#x2014;Celtic people, some of whom came from Ireland and were actually called Scots, Anglo-Saxons from the south, Norse from across the North Sea, and possibly some leftover Picts as well.<br><br>The high stony farm where my family lived for some time in the Ettrick Valley was called Far-Hope. The word <i>hope</i>, as used in the local geography, is an old word, a Norse word--Norse, Anglo-Saxon, and Gaelic words being all mixed up together in that part of the country, as you would expect, with some old Brythonic thrown in to indicate an early Welsh presence. <i>Hope</i> means a bay, not a bay filled with water but with land, partly enclosed by hills, which in this case are the high bare hills, the near mountains of the Southern Uplands. The Black Knowe, Bodesbeck Law, Ettrick Pen&#x2014;there you have the three big hills, with the word <i>hill</i> in three languages. Some of these hills are now being reforested, with plantations of Sitka spruce, but in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they would have been bare, or mostly bare&#x2014;the great Forest of Ettrick, the hunting grounds of the Kings of Scotland, having been cut down and turned into pasture or waste heath a century or two before.<br><br>The height of land above Far-Hope, which stands right at the end of the valley, is the spine of Scotland, marking the division of the waters that flow to the west into the Solway Firth and the Atlantic Ocean, from those that flow east into the North Sea. Within ten miles to the north is the country's most famous waterfall, the Grey Mare's Tail. Five miles from Moffat, which would be the market town to those living at the valley head, is the Devil's Beef Tub, a great cleft in the hills believed to be the hiding place for stolen cattle&#x2014;English cattle, that is, taken by the reivers in the lawless sixteenth century. In the lower Ettrick Valley was Aikwood, the home of Michael Scott, the philosopher and wizard of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, who appears in Dante's <i>Inferno</i>. And if that were not enough, William Wallace, the guerrilla hero of the Scots, is said to have hidden out here from the English, and there is a story of Merlin&#x2014;<i>Merlin</i>&#x2014;being hunted down and murdered, in the old forest, by Ettrick shepherds.<br><br>(As far as I know, my ancestors, generation after generation, were Ettrick shepherds. It may sound odd to have shepherds employed in a forest, but it seems that hunting forests were in many places open glades.)<br><br>Nevertheless the valley disappointed me the first time I saw it. Places are apt to do that when you've set them up in your imagination. The time of year was very early spring, and the hills were brown, or a kind of lilac brown, reminding me of the hills around Calgary. Ettrick Water was running fast and clear, but it was hardly as wide as the Maitland River, which flows past the farm where I grew up, in Ontario. The circles of stones which I had at first taken to be interesting remnants of Celtic worship were too numerous and well kept up to be anything but handy sheep pens.<br><br>I was travelling by myself, and I had come from Selkirk on the twice-a-week Shoppers' Bus, which took me no farther than Ettrick Bridge. There I wandered around, waiting for the postman. I'd been told that he would take me up the valley. The chief thing to be seen in Ettrick Bridge was a sign on a closed shop, advertising Silk Cut. I couldn't figure out what that might be. It turned out to be a well-known brand of cigarette.<br><br>After a while the postman came along and I rode with him to Ettrick Church. By that time it had begun to rain, hard. The church was locked. It disappointed me, too. Having been built in 1824, it did not compare, in historic appearance, or grim character, to the churches I had already seen in Scotland. I felt conspicuous, out of place, and cold. I huddled by the wall till the rain let up for a bit, and then I explored the churchyard, with the long wet grass soaking my legs.<br><br>There I found, first, the gravestone of William Laidlaw, my direct ancestor, born at the end of the seventeenth century, and known as Will O'Phaup. This was a man who took on, at least locally, something of the radiance of myth, and he managed that at the very last time in history&#x2014;that is, in the history of the people of the British Isles&#x2014;when a man could do so. The same stone bears the names of his daughter Margaret Laidlaw Hogg, who upbraided Sir Walter Scott, and of Robert Hogg, her husband, the tenant of Ettrickhall. Then right next to it I saw the stone of the writer James Hogg, who was their son and Will O'Phaup's grandson. He was known as The Ettrick Shepherd. And not far from that was the stone of the Reverend Thomas Boston, at one time famous throughout Scotland for his books and preaching, though fame never took him to any more important ministry.<br><br>Also, among various Laidlaws, a stone bearing the name of Robert Laidlaw, who died at Hopehouse January 29th 1800 aged seventy-two years. Son of Will, brother of Margaret, uncle of James, who probably never knew that he would be remembered by his link to these others, any more than he would know the date of his own death.<br><br>My great-great-great-great-grandfather.<br><br>As I was reading these inscriptions the rain came on again, lightly, and I thought I had better start to walk back to Tushielaw, where I was to catch the school bus for my return ride to Selkirk. I couldn't loiter, because the bus might be early, and the rain might get heavier.<br><br>I was struck with a feeling familiar, I suppose, to many people whose long history goes back to a country far away from the place where they grew up. I was a naive North American, in spite of my stored knowledge. Past and present lumped together here made a reality that was commonplace and yet disturbing beyond anything I had imagined.<br>MEN OF ETTRICK<br><br><i>Will O'Phaup</i><br><br>Here lyeth William Laidlaw, the far-famed Will o' Phaup, who for feats of frolic, agility and strength, had no equal in his day . . .<br><br>Epitaph composed by his grandson, James Hogg, on Will O'Phaup's tombstone in Ettrick Kirkyard.<br>His name was William Laidlaw, but his story-name was Will O'Phaup, Phaup being simply the local version of Far-Hope, the name of the farm he took over at the head of Ettrick Valley. It seems that Far-Hope had been abandoned for years when Will came to inhabit it. The house, that is, had been abandoned, because it was situated so high up at the end of the remote valley, and got the worst of the periodic winter storms and the renowned snowfall. The house of Potburn, the next one to it, lower down, was until recently said to be the highest inhabited house in all of Scotland. It now stands deserted, apart from the sparrows and finches busy around its outbuildings.<br><br>The land itself would not have belonged to Will, it would not even have been leased to him&#x2014;he would have rented the house or got it as part of his shepherd's wages. It was never worldly prosperity that he was after.<br><br>Only Glory.<br>He was not native to the valley, though there were Laidlaws there, and had been since the first records were kept. The earliest man of that name I have come across is in the court records of the thirteenth century, and he was up on charges of murdering another Laidlaw. No prisons in those days. Just dungeons, mainly for the upper class, or people of some political importance. And summary executions--but those happened mostly in times of large unrest, as during the border raids of the sixteenth century, when a marauder might be hanged at his own front door, or strung up in Selkirk Square, as were sixteen cattle thieves of the same name&#x2014;Elliott&#x2014;on a single day of punishment. My man got off with a fine.<br><br>Will was said to be "one of the old Laidlaws of Craik"&#x2014;about whom I have not been able to discover anything at all, except that Craik is an almost disappeared village on a completely disappeared Roman road, in a nearby valley to the south of Ettrick. He must have walked over the hills, a lad in his teens, looking for work. He had been born in 1695, when Scotland was still a separate country, though it shared a monarch with England. He would have been twelve years old at the time of the controversial Union, a young man by the time of the bitter failed Jacobite Rebellion of 1715, a man deep into middle age by the t...</p><h2>Hansel and Gretel</h2><p>Once upon a time,deep in&nbsp;the dark, green forest there was an exquisite house made of cake and sugar--a house made to lure lost, hungry children. &nbsp;But the witch whose delicious houselured Hansel and his sister, Gretel had forgotten two things about lost children: they&nbsp;can be&nbsp;very cleverand very brave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Cynthia Rylant has written more than 100 children's books, from board books and picture books, to chapter books and novels.

A graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design with a BFA in Illustration, Jen has worked extensively as a freelance illustrator and designer. She lives and works in Seattle.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;Rylant retells the familiar Grimm tale with an emphasis on the courage and character of its young protagonists. She opens by noting that while guardian spirits may protect small children, "Hansel and Gretel" is the story "of children who find the courage to protect themselves." She focuses on the family dynamics: the weakness of their father, the cruel machinations of the bitter stepmother, and the effect on the children. The language is forceful and direct throughout: the siblings learn that wickedness takes many forms, and that a smile often masks evil intentions. After escaping the witch, the children are helped on their way home by a large swan, and Rylant surmises that perhaps guardian spirits finally intervene "when small children have already been so brave." Complementing this retelling, Corace's pen-and-ink artwork features neutral hues and sober-faced children. The book has an old-fashioned, handcrafted look with illustrations and text carefully placed on each page. There are many fine versions of this tale, including Rika Lesser and Paul O. Zelinsky's version (Dutton, 1999), but libraries will want to add this distinctive retelling for Rylant's strong-minded voice and Corace's attractive art.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Senner is a professor of German and Scandinavian at Arizona State University.</p><h2>Patricia Neal: An Unquiet Life</h2><p>The internationally acclaimed actress Patricia Neal has been a star on stage, film, and television for nearly sixty years. On Broadway she appeared in such lauded productions as Lillian Hellman&#39;s Another Part of the Forest, for which she won the very first Tony Award, and The Miracle Worker. In Hollywood she starred opposite the likes of Ronald Reagan, Gary Cooper, John Wayne, Paul Newman, Fred Astaire, and Tyrone Power in some thirty films. Neal anchored such classic pictures as The Day the Earth Stood Still, A Face in the Crowd, and Breakfast at Tiffany&#39;s, but she is perhaps best known for her portrayal of Alma Brown in Hud, which earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1963. But there has been much, much more to Neal&#39;s life. She was born Patsy Louise Neal on January 20, 1926, in Packard, Kentucky, though she spent most of her childhood in Knoxville, Tennessee. Neal quickly gained attention for her acting abilities in high school, community, and college performances. Her early stage successes were overshadowed by the unexpected death of her father in 1944. Soon after she left New York for Hollywood in 1947, Neal became romantically involved with Gary Cooper, her married co-star in The Fountainhead, an attachment which brought them both a great deal of notoriety in the press and a great deal of heartache in their personal lives. In 1953, Neal married famed children&#39;s author Roald Dahl, a match that would bring her five children and thirty years of dramatic ups and downs. In 1961, their son, Theo, was seriously injured in an automobile accident and required multiple neurosurgeries and years of rehabilitation; the following year their daughter, Olivia, died of measles. At the pinnacle of her screen career, Patricia Neal suffered a series of strokes which left her in a coma for twenty-one days. Variety even ran a headline erroneously stating that she had died. At the time, Neal was pregnant with her and Dahl&#39;s fifth child, Lucy, who was born healthy a few months later. After a difficult recovery, Neal returned to film acting, earning a second Academy Award nomination for The Subject Was Roses. She appeared in a number of television movie roles in the 1970s and 1980s and won a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Dramatic TV Movie in 1971 for her role in The Homecoming. Patricia Neal: An Unquiet Life is the first critical biography detailing the actress&#39;s impressive film career and remarkable personal life. Author Stephen Michael Shearer has conducted numerous interviews with Neal, her professional colleagues, and her intimate friends and was given access to the actress&#39;s personal papers. The result is an honest and comprehensive portrait of an accomplished woman who has lived her life with determination and bravado.</p><p><b>Stephen Michael Shearer,</b> who has worked as a professional actor, has written for <i>The Film Collectors Registry</i> and contributed research to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences."This impressively researched biography of film actress Patricia Neal covers an immensity of material." &#x2015;(Salt Lake City) Deseret News"<p>"Shearer delivers an inspiring look at the professional triumphs and personal tragedies that define one of Hollywood's legendary stars." &#x2015;Des Moines Regiser"</p><p>"Patricial Neal has traveled the road from tirumph to despair in ways few of us can imagine.

The taglines included on the covers provide clues about each individual's contribution. In Dolley Madison, Krull covers the First Lady's popular "Wednesday Nights," formal dinners at the White House ("Parties can be patriotic"), which gave guests the opportunity to socialize and network. Sacajawea details Lewis and Clark's guide's knowledge of languages and the Northwest, which ensured the success of the expedition ("Lewis and Clark would be lost without me"). Sonia Sotomayor stresses the Supreme Court justice's lifelong commitment to making the right choices ("I'll be the judge of that") and working hard to overcome challenges and meet goals. Judy Blume describes the acclaimed author's commitment to writing honestly and realistically ("Are you there, reader? It's me, Judy!"), which has made her the target of censorship. An upbeat tone runs through these books, and Krull's language is accessible, occasionally making use of the vernacular, such as describing Sotomayor as being "jazzed" about a scholarship or referring to the Founding Fathers as "FF." Sacajawea's story has a guide for accurate name pronunciation, and there's an extensive further reading list, but quotes are unsourced. Several picture books and collected biographies about women are available, including some by Krull, but there hasn't been a series of individual books about women for this grade level since Blackbirch's "Library of Famous Women" and "Library of Famous Women Juniors." Interior color illustrations, executed by different illustrators and in different styles, further enhance these titles.

Well, we know you're busy. After spending hours on end cramming Shakespeare into your head, we're positive that the last thing you want to do is stand in front of a hot stove stirring sauce or waiting for a pot of water to boil. And c'mon&#x2014;a microwave is so much more accessible than a stove. Microwave in the student union or your dorm room? Check.Stovetop? Not so much.</p> <p>Microwaved vegan food. Yum! Okay, we're not totally na�ve here&#x2014;we know this probably conjures up an image of a bowl of nuked, wilted kale or some other oh-so-healthy (but possibly gag-inducing) green food. However, at PETA we're all about breaking stereotypes, so we've created a cookbook dedicated to vegan food that doesn't require a stove and tastes delicious. </p> <p>College is supposed to be the time in your life when you're really figuring out how to fend for yourself. You're already trying to figure out physics and how to get out of going to your 8 a.m., so who has time to learn how to flamb� or frapp�? Did you know you can actually make pasta without a pot or pancakes without a pan? Well, believe it, buddy. We can teach you all you need to know to make simple, effortless meals. You'll have plenty of time later on in life to make friends with your stove.</p> <p>We're betting you've been there&#x2014;nuking package after package of ramen. Opening the freezer with your fingers crossed, hoping there's a frozen burrito lurking behind the ice tray. Or gagging down some pizza, trying your hardest not to dwell on the fact that mold makes interesting shapes in a week&#x2014;anything to put off actually spending time and effort cooking a meal. That's where we come in.</p> <p>Why didn't we make a cookbook that's just like every other one out there? Because we love being the black sheep, the lone wolf, the creep in the back corner. Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea.<br> We dare to be different, and we bet you are itchin' to do the same.</p> <p><strong>Heads Up</strong><br> So we know you are old enough and smart enough to know how to work a microwave safely, but we still worry! Please humor us and keep the following in mind when using a microwave:</p> <ul> <li>Take extreme caution when removing containers of hot food and boiling water from the microwave to avoid spills and burns. Burns don't feel so hot. (Get it?)</li> <li> Although most plastic containers are microwave-safe, please double check before putting one in the microwave. When in doubt, use a container that is clearly marked "Microwave Safe" or "Microwaveable."</li> <li> Of course, no metal objects in the microwave! You know you don't want to be that guy&#x2014;the person in your dorm or apartment that catches the only working microwave on fire. </li> </ul> <p>Also, FYI, all of these recipes were tested in 700-watt microwaves and heated on the HIGH setting unless otherwise mentioned in the recipe. Cooking times may vary depending on altitude and microwave. </p> <p>OK , that should cover all of the boring, lecture-y stuff.

Leonard Gross has made this inspiring testimony accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. In an extended interpretive preface Gross situates this book with the life of Swiss Anabaptism and describes how the authors and compilers attempted to &#34;convince the reader that the suffering church remains faithful to the end in maintaining nonresistance and love, both as a means and as an end.&#34; At the beginning of the eighteenth century Anabaptists of Swiss origin faced four major challenges to their identity as a religious movement. The intense persecution of the sixteenth century had waned, but legal restrictions and resentment against their close-knit communities remained in some regions. Secondly, in the decade of the 1690s they experienced a painfulinternal division, the first major one among these Swiss heirs of the Radical Reformation, which eventuated in two broad groupings later known as Amish and as Mennonite. Thirdly, they had to cope with the impact of a religious renewal movement called Pietism, which swept through their Lutheran and Reformed neighbors. Fourthly, they faced the continuing question of how to relate to the theological traditions of their Anabaptist coreligionists from the Netherlands and from northern Germany. What resources of spirituality within their tradition would help the Swiss Anabaptists cope with these challenges? What aspects of their martyr heritage would build up the fellowship in the face of internal disunity and external pressures to dilute their theological heritage? &#34;Golden Apples in Silver Bowls&#34; served as an effective response to these dilemmas...</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>Boy: Tales of Childhood</h2><p><b><b>Find out where the bestselling author of&nbsp;</b><i><b>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and </b></i><b><i>The BFG </i>got all his wonderful story ideas in this autobiographical account of his childhood!&nbsp;</b></b><br><br>From his own life, of course!

His own father, my grandfather, was a fairly prosperous merchant who owned a store in Sarpsborg and traded in just about everything from cheese to chicken-wire.</p><p>I am writing these words in 1984, but this grandfather of mine was born, believe it or not, in 1820, shortly after Wellington had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. If my grandfather had been alive today he would have been one hundred and sixty-four years old. My father would have been one hundred and twenty-one. Both my father and my grandfather were late starters so far as children were concerned.</p><p>When my father was fourteen, which is still more than one hundred years ago, he was up on the roof of the family house replacing some loose tiles when he slipped and fell. He broke his left arm below the elbow. Somebody ran to fetch the doctor, and half an hour later this gentleman made a majestic and drunken arrival in his horse-drawn buggy. He was so drunk that he mistook the fractured elbow for a dislocated shoulder.</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ll soon put this back into place!&#x2019; he cried out, and two men were called off the street to help with the pulling. They were instructed to hold my father by the waist while the doctor grabbed him by the wrist of the broken arm and shouted, &#x2018;Pull men, pull! Pull as hard as you can!&#x2019;</p><p>The pain must have been excruciating. The victim screamed, and his mother, who was watching the performance in horror, shouted &#x2018;Stop!&#x2019; But by then the pullers had done so much damage that a splinter of bone was sticking out through the skin of the forearm.</p><p>This was in 1877 and orthopaedic surgery was not what it is today. So they simply amputated the arm at the elbow, and for the rest of his life my father had to manage with one arm. Fortunately, it was the left arm that he lost and gradually, over the years, he taught himself to do more or less anything he wanted with just the four fingers and thumb of his right hand. He could tie a shoelace as quickly as you or me, and for cutting up the food on his plate, he sharpened the bottom edge of a fork so that it served as both knife and fork all in one. He kept his ingenious instrument in a slim leather case and carried it in his pocket wherever he went. The loss of an arm, he used to say, caused him only one serious inconvenience. He found it impossible to cut the top off a boiled egg.</p><p>My father was a year or so older than his brother Oscar, but they were exceptionally close, and soon after they left school, they went for a long walk together to plan their future. They decided that a small town like Sarpsborg in a small country like Norway was no place in which to make a fortune. So what they must do, they agreed, was go away to one of the big countries, either to England or France, where opportunities to make good would be boundless.</p><p>Their own father, an amiable giant nearly seven foot tall, lacked the drive and ambition of his sons, and he refused to support this tomfool idea. When he forbade them to go, they ran away from home, and somehow or other the two of them managed to work their way to France on a cargo ship.</p><p>From Calais they went to Paris, and in Paris they agreed to separate because each of them wished to be independent of the other. Uncle Oscar, for some reason, headed west for La Rochelle on the Atlantic coast, while my father remained in Paris for the time being.</p><p>The story of how these two brothers each started a totally separate business in different countries and how each of them made a fortune is interesting, but there is no time to tell it here except in the briefest manner.</p><p>Take my Uncle Oscar first. La Rochelle was then, and still is, a fishing port. By the time he was forty he had become the wealthiest man in town. He owned a fleet of trawlers called &#x2018;P�cheurs d&#x2019;Atlantique&#x2019; and a large canning factory to can the sardines his trawlers brought in. He acquired a wife from a good family and a magnificent town house as well as a large ch�teau in the country. He became a collector of Louis XV furniture, good pictures and rare books, and all these beautiful things together with the two properties are still in the family. I have not seen the ch�teau in the country, but I was in the La Rochelle house a couple of years ago and it really is something. The furniture alone should be in a museum.</p><p>While Uncle Oscar was bustling around in La Rochelle, his onearmed brother Harald (my own father) was not sitting on his rump doing nothing. He had met in Paris another young Norwegian called Aadnesen and the two of them now decided to form a partnership and become shipbrokers. A shipbroker is a person who supplies a ship with everything it needs when it comes into port &#x2013; fuel and food, ropes and paint, soap and towels, hammers and nails, and thousands of other tiddly little items. A shipbroker is a kind of enormous shopkeeper for ships, and by far the most important item he supplies to them is the fuel on which the ship&#x2019;s engines run. In those days fuel meant only one thing. It meant coal. There were no oil-burning motorships on the high seas at that time. All ships were steamships and these old steamers would take on hundreds and often thousands of tons of coal in one go. To the shipbrokers, coal was black gold.</p><p>My father and his new-found friend, Mr Aadnesen, understood all this very well. It made sense they told each other, to set up their shipbroking business in one of the great coaling ports of Europe. Which was it to be? The answer was simple. The greatest coaling port in the world at that time was Cardiff, in South Wales. So off to Cardiff they went, these two ambitious young men, carrying with them little or no luggage. But my father had something more delightful than luggage. He had a wife, a young French girl called Marie whom he had recently married in Paris.</p><p>In Cardiff, the shipbroking firm of &#x2018;Aadnesen &amp; Dahl&#x2019; was set up and a single room in Bute Street was rented as an office. From then on, we have what sounds like one of those exaggerated fairy-stories of success, but in reality it was the result of tremendous hard and brainy work by those two friends. Very soon &#x2018;Aadnesen &amp; Dahl&#x2019; had more business than the partners could handle alone. Larger office space was acquired and more staff were engaged. The real money then began rolling in. Within a few years, my father was able to buy a fine house in the village of Llandaff, just outside Cardiff, and there his wife Marie bore him two children, a girl and a boy. But tragically, she died after giving birth to the second child.</p><p>When the shock and sorrow of her death had begun to subside a little, my father suddenly realized that his two small children ought at the very least to have a stepmother to care for them. What is more, he felt terribly lonely. It was quite obvious that he must try to find himself another wife. But this was easier said than done for a Norwegian living in South Wales who didn&#x2019;t know very many people. So he decided to take a holiday and travel back to his own country, Norway, and who knows, he might if he was lucky find himself a lovely new bride in his own country.</p><p>Over in Norway, during the summer of 1911, while taking a trip in a small coastal steamer in the Oslofjord, he met a young lady called Sofie Magdalene Hesselberg. Being a fellow who knew a good thing when he saw one, he proposed to her within a week and married her soon after that.</p><p>Harald Dahl took his Norwegian wife on a honeymoon in Paris, and after that back to the house in Llandaff. The two of them were deeply in love and blissfully happy, and during the next six years she bore him four children, a girl, another girl, a boy (me) and a third girl. There were now six children in the family, two by my father&#x2019;s first wife and four by his second. A larger and grander house was needed and the money was there to buy it.</p><p>So in 1918, when I was two, we all moved into an imposing country mansion beside the village of Radyr, about eight miles west of Cardiff. I remember it as a mighty house with turrets on its roof and with majestic lawns and terraces all around it. There were many acres of farm and woodland, and a number of cottages for the staff. Very soon, the meadows were full of milking cows and the sties were full of pigs and the chicken-run was full of chickens. There were several massive shire-horses for pulling the ploughs and the hay-wagons, and there was a ploughman and a cowman and a couple of gardeners and all manner of servants in the house itself. Like his brother Oscar in La Rochelle, Harald Dahl had made it in no uncertain manner.</p><p>But what interests me most of all about these two brothers, Harald and Oscar, is this. Although they came from a simple unsophisticated small-town family, both of them, quite independently of one another, developed a powerful interest in beautiful things. As soon as they could afford it, they began to fill their houses with lovely paintings and fine furniture. In addition to that, my father became an expert gardener and above all a collector of alpine plants. My mother used to tell me how the two of them would go on expeditions up into the mountains of Norway and how he would frighten her to death by climbing one-handed up steep cliff-faces to reach small alpine plants growing high up on some rocky ledge. He was also an accomplished wood-carver, and most of the mirror-frames in the house were his own work. So indeed was the entire mantelpiece around the fireplace in the living-room, a splendid design of fruit and foliage and intertwining branches carved in oak.</p><p>He was a tremendous diary-writer. I still have one of his many notebooks from the Great War of 1914&#x2013;18. Every single day during those five war years he would write several pages of comment and observation about the events of the time. He wrote with a pen and although Norwegian was his mother-tongue, he always wrote his diaries in perfect English.</p><p>He harboured a curious theory about how to develop a sense of beauty in the minds of his children. Every time my mother became pregnant, he would wait until the last three months of her pregnancy and then he would announce to her that &#x2018;the glorious walks&#x2019; must begin. These glorious walks consisted of him taking her to places of great beauty in the countryside and walking with her for about an hour each day so that she could absorb the splendour of the surroundings. His theory was that if the eye of a pregnant woman was constantly observing the beauty of nature, this beauty would somehow become transmitted to the mind of the unborn baby within her womb and that baby would grow up to be a lover of beautiful things. This was the treatment that all of his children received before they were born.</p><p><i>Kindergarten, 1922&#x2013;3 (age 6&#x2013;7)</i></p><p>In 1920, when I was still only three, my mother&#x2019;s eldest child, my own sister Astri, died fro...</p></p><h2>Knit Noro: 30 Designs in Living Color (Knit Noro Collection)</h2><p>Japanese designer Eisaku Noro creates some of the world&#39;s most magnificent yarns-made from exquisite natural materials and color-blended into stunning hues, they&#39;re prized by knitters everywhere.

Castaneda's now classic book remains controversial for the alternative way of <i>seeing</i> that it presents and the revolution in cognition it demands.<br><br>In a series of fascinating dialogues, Castaneda sets forth his partial initiation with don Juan Matus, a Yaqui Indian shaman from the state of Sonora, Mexico. He describes don Juan's perception and mastery of the "non-ordinary reality" and how peyote along with other plants sacred to the Mexican Indians were used as gateways to the mysteries of "dread," "clarity," and "power." <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> is the story of a remarkable journey that has left an indelible impression on the life of more than a million readers around the world.<br><br><i>"For me there is only the traveling on paths that have heart, on any path that may have heart. There I travel, and the only worthwhile challenge is to traverse its full length. And there I travel, looking, looking breathlessly."&#x2014;Don Juan</i><br><br><i>"Carlos Castaneda, under the tutelage of don Juan, takes us through the moment of twilight, through the crack in the universe between daylight and dark into a world not merely other than our own, but of an entirely different order of reality."&#x2014;Walter Goldschmidt, from the Foreword</i></p><p>Carlos Castaneda's intelligence shines through as clearly in his updated commentary in the 30th anniversary edition of <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> as it does in his original story. It is impossible to encapsulate what Castaneda has achieved with his first book about the teachings of the enigmatic Don Juan Matus, a Yaqui Indian sorcerer who shared his ancient knowledge with Castaneda. The academic character of <i>The Teachings of Don Juan</i> is evident in Castaneda's in-depth analysis (and sometimes overanalysis) of his experiences with Don Juan, and readers who lack an interest in anthropological analysis may find this section a bit tedious. However, Castaneda's journal accounts flow effortlessly, the current carrying us through his conversations with Don Juan and opening doors to an astounding realm outside the bounds of everyday life. The phrases "life changing" and "earth shattering" come to mind, and perhaps these are just metaphors, but what Castaneda offered in the 1960s is still for many an entirely new perception of reality. --<i>Brian Patterson</i><i>MORE THAN ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD</i><p></p></p><h2>Spirit Wolf (Wolves of the Beyond)</h2><p>Faolan, a wolf once doomed to die, struggles to fufill his destiny as the leader of the wolves of Beyond.<br><br>No one ever saw Faolan as a leader.

Her engaging memoir retraces those early years caring for the indigent and unfortunate during the pinched postwar era in London, when health care was nearly nonexistent, antibiotics brand-new, sanitary facilities rare, contraception unreliable and families with 13 or more children the norm. Working alongside the trained nurses and midwives of St. Raymund Nonnatus (a pseudonym she's given the place), Worth made frequent visits to the tenements that housed the dock workers and their families, often in the dead of night on her bicycle. Her well-polished anecdotes are teeming with character detail of some of the more memorable nurses she worked with, such as the six-foot-two Camilla Fortescue-Cholmeley-Browne, called Chummy, who renounced her genteel upbringing to become a nurse, or the dotty old Sister Monica Joan, who fancied cakes immoderately. Patients included Molly, only 19 and already trapped in poverty and degradation with several children and an abusive husband; Mrs. Conchita Warren, who was delivering her 24th baby; or the birdlike vagrant, Mrs. Jenkins, whose children were taken away from her when she entered the workhouse. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Biographies continue to appear with regularity, despite the strong hold the Plath estate has on her work. But because of that hold, each biographer has been forced to accommodate the living (Ted Hughes, who was separated from Plath at the time of her death, and his larger-than-life sister, Olwyn, long the executrix), often at the expense of the dead. In 1989, Anne Stevenson's peculiar hybrid, <i>Bitter Fame</i>, was published, complete with an appendix full of devastating memoirs. It was not your average biography. When Janet Malcolm was first sent the book, she was less drawn to it by the Plath legend than by the fact that she had known Stevenson in the '50s, but she soon became captivated by the book's defeatist subtext. The dead woman's voice and writings seemed to overwhelm Stevenson's tentative narrative; and if that wasn't enough, there was also the none-too-angelic choir of those who had known Plath. "These too, said, 'Don't listen to Anne Stevenson. She didn't know Sylvia. I knew Sylvia. Let me tell you about her. Read my correspondence with her. Read my memoir.'" <p> <i>Bitter Fame</i> was soon garnering some powerfully bad notices, especially that of A. Alvarez in the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. Alvarez, the author of one of the most influential pieces on Plath, in his study of suicide, <i>The Savage God</i>, had some special, personal cards to deal, as have so many others Plath left behind. Because Malcolm's great theme is treachery--that of the interviewer, the journalist, the teller of just about any tale--the Plath mess seemed a perfect fit, and she decided to become a player, too. In 1991, Malcolm was having lunch with Olwyn Hughes in North London, 28 years to the day on which the poet died. </p><p> This is only one of the coincidences in <i>The Silent Woman</i>, a postmodern biography par excellence, which is less about the drama of Plath's life and still controversial death than about their continuing effect on the living. For Malcolm, all cards are wild, each one revealing more complexity, human cravenness, and, above all, brilliantly playful aper�us about human agency and writing's deceptions. I look forward to the dictionary of quotations that foregrounds the elegant "The pleasure of hearing ill of the dead is not a negligible one, but it pales before the pleasure of hearing ill of the living." And then there's, "Memory is notoriously unreliable; when it is intertwined with ill will, it may be monstrously unreliable. The 'good' biographer is supposed to be able to discriminate among the testimonies of witnesses and have his antennae out for tendentious distortions, misrememberings, and outright lies." It's clear that Malcolm doesn't see herself as a "good" biographer--she openly declares her allegiance, but is more than capable of changing it and of showing her cards. Or is she? In the end, <i>The Silent Woman </i> is a stunning inquiry into the possibility of ever really knowing anything save that "the game continues."</p>From the moment it was first published in The New Yorker, this brilliant work of literary criticism aroused great attention. Janet Malcolm brings her shrewd intelligence to bear on the legend of Sylvia Plath and the wildly productive industry of Plath biographies.

Even before the universe was created, God had you in mind, and he planned you for his purposes. These purposes will extend far beyond the few years you will spend on earth. You were made to last forever! Self-help books often suggest that you try to discover the meaning and purpose of your life by looking within yourself, but Rick Warren says that is the wrong place to start. You must begin with God, your Creator, and his reasons for creating you. You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense. This book will help you understand why you are alive and God&#39;s amazing plan for you---both here and now, and for eternity. Rick Warren will guide you through a personal 40-day spiritual journey that will transform your answer to life&#39;s most important question: What on earth am I here for? Knowing God&#39;s purpose for creating you will reduce your stress, focus your energy, simplify your decisions, give meaning to your life, and, most importantly, prepare you for eternity. The Purpose-Driven Life is a blueprint for Christian living in the 21st century---a lifestyle based on God&#39;s eternal purposes, not cultural values. Using over 1,200 scriptural quotes and references, it challenges the conventional definitions of worship, fellowship, discipleship, ministry, and evangelism. In the tradition of Oswald Chambers, Rick Warren offers distilled wisdom on the essence of what life is all about. This is a book of hope and challenge that you will read and re-read, and it will be a classic treasured by generations to come.</p><p>The spiritual premise in <i>The Purpose-Driven Life</i> is that there are no accidents---God planned everything and everyone. Therefore, every human has a divine purpose, according to God's master plan. Like a twist on John F. Kennedy's famous inaugural address, this book could be summed up like this: "So my fellow Christians, ask not what God can do for your life plan, ask what your life can do for God's plan." Those who are looking for advice on finding one's calling through career choice, creative expression, or any form of self-discovery should go elsewhere. This is not about self-exploration; it is about purposeful devotion to a Christian God. The book is set up to be a 40-day immersion plan, recognizing that the Bible favors the number 40 as a "spiritually significant time," according to author Rick Warren, the founding pastor of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, California, touted as one of the nation largest congregations. Warren's hope is that readers will "interact" with the 40 chapters, reading them one day at a time, with extensive underlining and writing in the margins. As an inspirational manifesto for creating a more worshipful, church-driven life, this book delivers. Every page is laden with references to scripture or dogma. But it does not do much to address the challenges of modern Christian living, with its competing material, professional, and financial distractions. Nonetheless, this is probably an excellent resource for devout Christians who crave a jumpstart back to worshipfulness. --<i>Gail Hudson</i>The #1 New York Times Bestseller, with over 3 million sold, now available in a large print edition <p>The Purpose-Driven� Life is a blueprint for a lifestyle based on God&#x2019;s eternal purposes, not cultural values.

It moved into the mainstream with Andy Warhol's iconic screen print of Marilyn Monroe, and was quickly adopted by artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg. Screen printing has become even more widespread with the many demonstrations, marches, and grassroots protests in the wake of the American presidential election of 2016. <em>Screen Printing: The Ultimate Studio Guide</em> is a definitive, fully illustrated manual on the techniques, materials, and processes of screen printing. An essential and highly practical reference, this book is equally suited for beginning and experienced printers, with step-by-step tutorials on basic and advanced techniques, as well as "workshops" by several of the world's best-known screen printers, including Ben Eine and Bob Gill.</p><p>Print Club London is a leading print studio specializing in the art, practice, teaching, and exhibition of screenprinting.

His father, a poor barber-surgeon, wandered up and down Spain in search of work. Educated as a child by the Jesuits in Seville, the creator of <b>Don Quixote</b> grew up to follow the career of a professional soldier. He was wounded at Lepanto in 1571, captured by the Turks in 1575, imprisoned for five years, and was finally rescued by the Trinitarian friars in 1580. On his return to Spain he found his family more impoverished than ever before. Supporting his mother, two sisters, and an illegitimate daughter, he settled down to a literary career and had hopes of becoming a successful playwright, but just then the youthful <b>Lope de Vega</b> entered triumphantly to transform the Spanish theatre by his genius. <b>Galatea</b>, a pastoral romance, was published in 1585, the year of Cervantes&#x2019; marriage to <b>Catalina de Palacios y Salazar Vozmediano</b>. But it did not bring him an escape from poverty, and he was forced to become a roving commissary for the Spanish armada. This venture, which led to bankruptcy and jail, lasted for fifteen years. Although he never knew prosperity, Cervantes did gain a measure of fame during his lifetime, and Don Quixote and Sancho Panza were known all over the world. Part I of Don Quixote was published in 1605; in 1613, his <b>Exemplary Novels</b> appeared, and these picaresque tales of romantic adventure gained immediate popularity. <b>Journey to Parnassas</b>, a satirical review of his fellow Spanish poets, appeared in 1614, and Part II of Don Quixote in 1615 as well as <b>Eight Plays and Eight Interludes</b>.

She lives in New York City with her husband, television producer Robert Bradford. This is her twenty-fourth novel. </p>Chapter One &nbsp;She&#x2019;s dead!" <p></p>Cecil Williams made this announcement from the entrance to the dining room at Ravenscar, the great Elizabethan house in Yorkshire. Then closing the door behind him, he walked across to the table in a few quick strides. It was 1996, and this news was momentous. <p></p>Against her own volition, Elizabeth Turner jumped up. "<i>When?</i>" she asked in a voice full of sudden tension, her eyes riveted on his face. <p></p>"This morning, very early. Just before dawn, to be exact." <p></p>There was a silence. <p></p>Elizabeth took tight control of a rush of emotion; even though this news had been long expected, deep down she had not believed she would ever hear those words. She took a moment to absorb them, then said, "There&#x2019;s nothing much to say, is there, Cecil? Nothing at all, actually, and anyway, what would be the point? I&#x2019;m not a hypocrite, I&#x2019;m not going to pretend I mourn my sister&#x2019;s death." <p></p>"Nor am I. I understand your feelings perfectly, Elizabeth." He put an arm around her shoulder, kissed her cheek, and drawing back, looked deeply into her luminous gray-black eyes. At once he noticed they were glistening with tears and knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that the tears were not for the deceased woman. They were, in fact, tears of genuine relief. <p></p>"It&#x2019;s over, Elizabeth," he said, very softly. "<i>Finally</i>. Your torment is at an end, and you&#x2019;re safe, secure. No one can tell you what to do, not ever again. You&#x2019;re your own woman, and in control of your own destiny." <p></p>The tense expression on her pale face instantly lifted, and she exclaimed, "Yes, I am free. Free at last! Oh, Cecil, how wonderful that thought is! Yet, do you know, I can hardly grasp it." A quavery smile flickered around her mouth and was immediately gone, as if she was not quite convinced of her new status. <p></p>He smiled at her. "I believe it&#x2019;s going to take a few days to sink in." <p></p>She looked at him intently, her eyes narrowing slightly. He knew her well, truly understood her, and he was correct, it would take a few days for her to truly believe that everything had changed. She took a moment to steady herself before saying, "I&#x2019;m being rude, Cecil. Let me get you some breakfast, you must be famished. Lucas has brought in enough food to feed an army, so what do you fancy?" <p></p>"I am hungry, I must admit. But I&#x2019;ll help myself. Go and sit down, drink your coffee and relax. You have every reason to do so today of all days." <p></p>Elizabeth did as he suggested, glad to sit down in the comfortable chair. She was shaking inside and her legs felt weak and unsteady. As she settled back, endeavoring to relax, she experienced instead an unexpected sense of dread. The future loomed up in front of her; it was an unknown future. <i>Overwhelming</i>. A wave of nausea swept over her at the prospect of leaving her old life behind, grasping her destiny with both hands. All those years of sleepless nights, early risings, often before dawn. Constantly worrying, always fearful, numb with anxiety, forever apprehensive. About her sister. Never knowing...never knowing what tricks Mary would pull, what accusations the woman would level at her. She had been living on the edge, on the edge of danger, living on her nerves for as long as she could remember. Mary had tormented her since childhood. <p></p>A moment later, Cecil returned with a plate of food and sat down next to her. After eating a few mouthfuls of scrambled eggs, he remarked, "You must have been up when it was still dark outside. I was surprised when I found your door open and the bedroom empty at six thirty this morning." <p></p>"I couldn&#x2019;t sleep, so I finally got up. This past week has been, horrendous, and I&#x2019;m afraid my feelings did get the better of me.... It was the endless waiting and waiting, I suppose. Cancer is unpredictable like that." <p></p>He glanced at her, his steady gray eyes searching her face. He had worried about her for years, and he would always worry about her, he was well aware of that. His devotion to her was absolute, and his one thought at the moment was to protect her at all cost. But he made no comment, merely went on calmly eating his breakfast. He was a steady, careful man, and his plans were in place. <p></p>After finishing her cup of coffee, Elizabeth ran a hand over her mouth and confided, "I never worried about her being ill, you know. I didn&#x2019;t. What was the point? And, after all, we knew she was dying, that the cancer was eating away at her, that she was deluded about being pregnant. But last week...well, I couldn&#x2019;t help remembering things from the past. The good things. <i>And the bad</i>. From our <i>girlhood</i> mostly...the time when our father disowned us both. Well, we <i>were</i> close then, if only for a short while. And the rest of the time I spent with her&#x2014;" Elizabeth broke off, shook her head. "The rest of the time was extremely difficult. She was impossible. I was the enemy in her eyes. She was so very possessive of our father. <i>My</i> mother had usurped <i>hers</i>, and <i>I</i> had usurped <i>her</i>, my father, of course, being the great prize, that great bull of a man, to be cozied up to and adored. <i>Unconditionally</i>. She was competitive, and as everyone knows, she always believed I was plotting against her." Elizabeth let out a long sigh. "No matter what, I was in the wrong with Mary from the day I was born." <p></p>"All that&#x2019;s over, don&#x2019;t dwell on it. You&#x2019;re starting a new life ...this is a new beginning for you," he said reassuringly. <p></p>"And I aim to live my new life well," she answered, mustering a positive tone, and stood up, crossed to the sideboard, poured herself another cup of coffee. A few seconds later, between sips, she asked, "Who knows about Mary&#x2019;s death? Everyone, I suppose?" <p></p>"Not quite, not yet." Cecil looked across at the grandfather clock standing in a corner of the dining room. "It&#x2019;s not yet eight, and it <i>is</i> Sunday, so I&#x2019;ve kept my phone calls to a minimum. For the moment. Nicholas Throckman was the first one to phone, to tell me Mary was dead, and then immediately afterwards I heard from Charles Broakes, who announced the same thing." <p></p>Staring at him with a frown, Elizabeth exclaimed, "Your famous mobile! That&#x2019;s how everyone got in touch. No wonder I didn&#x2019;t hear any phones ringing." <p></p>"I asked Nicholas and Charles to call me on the mobile. Why should the whole household be awakened at six in the morning?" He shook his head. "Like you, I hardly slept last night. I knew she couldn&#x2019;t last much longer." <p></p>"I assume Nicholas is on his way here. With the black box." <p></p>"He is. Actually, he&#x2019;s had possession of the box since Friday. Mary&#x2019;s people sent it to him that afternoon, so that he could bring it to you immediately. They thought she was about to die that day, but it was a false alarm. This morning, within half an hour of hearing the news, he set off. He&#x2019;s driving up here right now, and he asked me to tell you he looks forward to joining us for Sunday lunch." <p></p>She smiled for the first time in days. "I&#x2019;m glad to hear it." <p></p>"Sidney Payne also phoned. He was all for hightailing it up here, but I told him not to, explained we would be in London later in the week and I would be in touch then. He told me three people had called him already, so the news of Mary&#x2019;s death is spreading fast." Cecil grimaced. "Everyone loves to gossip, to speculate, so important news spreads like wildfire." <p></p>Leaning forward, Elizabeth asked with sudden eagerness, "Who are we inviting to our first meeting?" <p></p>"Your great-uncle Howard must be there, your cousins Francis Knowles and Henry Carray, Sidney Payne should come, plus some of the board members who have long been waiting for this day." <p></p>She nodded. "I know who they are, and I can&#x2019;t wait to see them. But what about those in the company who are against me?" <p></p>"What can <i>they</i> do?" Cecil asked, shaking his head. "Nothing! They cannot challenge you, Elizabeth. You are the rightful heir to Deravenels through your father&#x2019;s will." <p></p>"They can torpedo me, work against me, trip me up, do me in, call it what you will." She shrugged. "They&#x2019;re Mary&#x2019;s cronies, and they&#x2019;ll never like me. They never have." <p></p>"Who cares? <i>Liking you</i> is of no import! They have to <i>respect</i> you. That&#x2019;s vital, the only thing that matters. And I&#x2019;m going to make damned sure they will." <p></p>Mary Turner, her sister, was dead. No, not Mary Turner, but Mary Turner Alvarez, wife of Philip Alvarez, the greatest tycoon in Madrid, a man who had used her money, weakened her resources, then abandoned her to die alone. But that was what men did, wasn&#x2019;t it? Used women, then discarded them. Her father had taken all the prizes for doing just that. Don&#x2019;t think ill of him now, Elizabeth warned herself. It was <i>his</i> last will and testament that had held in the end. She was his third and last heir. And now Deravenels was hers. <p></p>Toward the end, Mary had had no alternative but to follow Harry Turner&#x2019;s wishes. Nonetheless, earlier there had been desperate attempts on her sister&#x2019;s part to cheat <i>her</i> out of her rightful inheritance. <p></p>Mary had first named her unborn son, that nonexistent child she fantasized about, the one she thought she carried in her swollen belly, as heir apparent. It was not new life reclining there but an inoperable cancer. <p></p>After this had come her most brilliant brainstorm, as Mary had called it. Her Spanish husband must inherit. After all, wasn&#x2019;t he the most famous businessman in Spain, a seasoned entrepreneur; and who better than him to run the ancient company? <p></p>When this idea was promptly scuttled by those who <i>could</i> scuttle it, Mary had seized on their cousin Marie Stewart, she of Scottish-French descent and upbringing, a woman who was ninety percent French, barely English at all. At the time, Cecil had wondered what this Gallic vamp could possibly know about running an eight-hundred-year-old trading company based in London, one that was a male bastion of self-centered chauvinism. Nothing, they had agreed, marveling at Mary Turner&#x2019;s gall. <p></p>Marie Stewart had long claimed she was the rightful heir, pointing out that her right to inherit came through her English grandmother, Margaret Turner, elder sister of Harry. But it was Harry who represented the direct male line from his father; therefore, his offspring, whether male or female, took precedence over his sister Margaret&#x2019;s line. It all had to do with the rule of primogeniture and the eldest son and his descendants being the true inheritors. <p></p>Once again, this idea of Mary Turner&#x2019;s had been swiftly killed. The board of Deravenels wanted nothing to do with Marie Stewart, whom they viewed as the enemy for a variety of reasons. And that would always be their stance. <p></p>And so at the very end her sister, Mary, had finally acknowledged <i>her</i>, although not actually by name. Something seemed to prevent Mary from doing that. But ten days ago she had sent a suitcase with one of her assistants. It contained Turner family jewels and a lot of keys, for bank vaults, safes, and various Turner homes. <p></p>Her wise Cecil had pointed out, "This is her <i>way</i> of acknowledging you, Elizabeth. She <i>is</i> going to fulfill your father&#x2019;s last will and testament in the end. You&#x2019;ll see. Her actions are more important than any words she might utter." <p></p>But why couldn&#x2019;t her sister have said her name? Why couldn&#x2019;t she have said "my sister, my heir Elizabeth Turner"? Why had she merely muttered something about Harry Turner&#x2019;s rightful heir? <p></p>Because she hated you, Elizabeth now thought, and she couldn&#x2019;t bear the idea that you were about to take her place. <p></p><i>Let it go, let it go</i>, a small voice said inside her head, and she endeavored to push these thoughts away. What did it matter now? Mary Turner Alvarez was dead. She, Elizabeth Deravenel Turner, was alive and well and about to become managing director of Deravenels. It was all hers now. The company, the houses, the jewels, the power, and the wealth. And she wanted it. Who wouldn&#x2019;t? Also, it was hers by right. She was a Deravenel and a Turner through and through. She was Harry&#x2019;s girl, and she looked exactly like him. Mary hadn&#x2019;t resembled Harry at all. She had looked like her Spanish mother, but she had also been much smaller than Catherine, somewhat squat and not half as pretty. <p></p>Moving across the floor of her bedroom, Elizabeth opened the cupboard door, pulled out the suitcase Mary had sent, and carried it to the bed. She found the key in her desk drawer, opened the case, and rummaged around, looking at some of the brown leather pouches, which had engraved silver nameplates stitched on the front. One said "Waverley Court, Kent," another "Ravenscar, Yorkshire," a third, "the Chelsea house," and all of them were full of keys. Then there were pouches pertaining to bank vaults at Coutts, the Westminster Bank, and Lloyd&#x2019;s, and keys for those vaults. <p></p>Cecil had told her that these bank vaults contained Deravenel and Turner jewels, other valuables, such as silver objects and tea services, canteens of silver, gold objects, and ancient documents. He had pointed out that she, as the new owner, would have to visit each bank vault when they returned to London, to check on everything. <p></p>Placing the pouches to one side, Elizabeth smoothed her long fingers over several red leather boxes from Cartier, then opened them all. One contained a superb diamond necklace, the next a pair of extraordinary emerald-cut emerald earrings, and the last a huge sapphire-and diamond pin. It struck her that this jewelry was not only fabulous but obviously from the 1930s, and she couldn&#x2019;t help wondering which member of the family had bought such gems. And for whom. She also wondered if she would ever wear any of it. Perhaps not, but she would certainly wear the South Sea pearls she had examined with Cecil the other day. <p></p>Taking the pearls out of their black-velvet case, she held them up to the light. How lustrous they were...truly lovely. Yes, these she <i>would</i> wear. <p></p>After returning everything to the suitcase, she locked it and put it back in the cupboard to be dealt with later. There were more pressing things to do in the next few weeks. The bank vaults would have to wait, and so would the two houses, Waverley Court and the house in Chelsea where Mary had lived for some years, and where she had died today. Later this week her sister would be buried in the family cemetery here, at Ravenscar, where all the Deravenels and Turners were buried. There was the funeral to be planned, people to be invited. <p></p>Elizabeth sat down at her desk, opened her diary, and turned the pages, came to the page for today: <i>Sunday, November 17th, 1996</i>. At the top of the page she wrote: <i>My sister, Mary Turner Alvarez, died at dawn this morning. She was forty-two years old</i>. <p></p>As she sat back in the chair, staring at the wall, Elizabeth&#x2019;s mind raced. Going to Deravenels and taking over the running of the company terrified her. But she had no choice. What would she do first? How would she and Cecil implement her plans? And his, which were complex? She had no idea how she would manage. She had worked at Deravenels off and on since she was eight...</p><h2>The Book of Common Prayer: The Administration of the Sacraments and Other Rites and Ceremonies of the Church in the English Parochial Tradition, According to Orthodox Catholic Usage</h2><p>This edition is specifically designed for use by Western rite parishes of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

Now survivor&#x2019;s guilt has driven Carpenter back to the damned&#x2019;s domain to attempt a wholesale rescue of its tortured denizens. His sidekick this time is the poet Sylvia Path, with whom Carpenter shares an uncommon literary perspective on their surroundings. In their trek through hell&#x2019;s darkest corners, the pair enlists the aid of such historic figures as J. Robert Oppenheimer, J. Edgar Hoover, and militant atheist Bertrand Russell. Satan, however, has other ideas. While the territory is perhaps too littered with celebrities in this installment, Niven and Pournelle&#x2019;s further life experience helps them add gravitas to Carpenter&#x2019;s philosophical contemplations. Meanwhile, their collaborative narrative magic is as compelling as ever. --Carl Hays</p><h2>Into the Depths of God: Where Eyes See the Invisible, Ears Hear the Inaudible, and Minds Conceive the Inconceivable</h2><p><i>A Life-Changing Journey of the Heart-<p></p> </i><p></p> <p>The waters of life are rough at the surface. But beneath the choppy waves of circumstances is a peaceful, unchanging haven-a dwelling place in God-a secret rendezvous with Him.</p> <p>Entering into the depths of the fullness of God is not some distant thing for which a Christian must struggle throughout life. It is as near as one's heart, a majestic doorway that leads to the reality of God. The apostle Paul wrote: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for those who love him" (1 Corinthians 2:9).</p> <p>For those desiring a deep relationship with God, Calvin Miller shows believers how to break the tyranny of the things that bind up their hearts and then discover an intimacy with God that is too overwhelming to be measured by our senses alone.</p></p><p><i>Into the Depths of God</i> by Calvin Miller gives guidance to Christians who are not satisfied by superficial relationships with God. Miller is a pastor, poet, painter, and theologian who has written more than 30 books (including the bestselling <i>Singer Trilogy</i>). In four main sections, "The Disciplined Life," "The Listening Life," "The Informed Life," and "The Confessional Life," Miller describes a vision of worship that will help readers escape the tyranny of forces that limit their perception of God, and explore more deeply God's mysterious presence that always beckons to us. Miller is a lively, entertaining writer who's not afraid of taking risks to get his points across: "How often the church is like Gilligan's Island," begins one argument. The analogy works surprisingly well: "None of [the characters] were going anywhere really. They were just living, and talking about a bigger world. But their conversation never amounted to much and none of them sacrificed themselves in any major way to get off their island prison." With Miller's guidance, many of us will finally break out of our prisons and into the freedom of God.

It is also one of the largest. This history is the story of commercial success: of how a small Victorian City partnership grew, in less than 150 years, to employ more than 50,000 people in 118 countries.<br>Few Victorian partnerships have survived, let alone with their founding principles and ideals still driving the business. True and Fair shows how Price Waterhouse adapted to the changing fortunes of the British and then global economy and a rapidly developing commercial environment. Among the themes discussed are Edwin Waterhouse's unprecedented success in building an audit practice, the internationalisation of the partnership and setting up of an operation in America, the meteoric career of Sir Gilbert Garnsey, a company doctor during the 1920s, the impact of two world wars, the growth of management consultancy, and latterly the firm's involvement in privatisation.<br>This study seeks to explain how Price Waterhouse could remain at the forefront of its profession for over 140 years when so many famous practices have disappeared through amalgamation or take-over. Edgar Jones was granted full access to the firm's archives and has spent over four years researching this exemplary and definitive company history.</p><p></p><h2>Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Technology Products to Mainstream Customers</h2><p>Examines marketing strategies for high-tech products and why they differ from those in other industries.</p><p><p>Geoffrey A.

There are two kinds of "experts" in question--the PR spin doctors behind the scenes and the "independent" experts paraded before the public, scientists who have been hand-selected, cultivated, and paid handsomely to promote the views of corporations involved in controversial actions. Lively writing on controversial topics such as dioxin, bovine growth hormone, and genetically modified food makes this a real page-turner, shocking in its portrayal of the real and potential dangers in each of these technological innovations and of the "media pseudo-environment" created to obfuscate the risks. By financing and publicizing views that support the goals of corporate sponsors, PR campaigns have, over the course of the century, managed to suppress the dangers of lead poisoning for decades, silence the scientist who discovered that rats fed on genetically modified corn had significant organ abnormalities, squelch television and newspaper stories about the risks of bovine growth hormone, and place enough confusion and doubt in the public's mind about global warming to suppress any mobilization for action. <p> Rampton and Stauber introduce the movers and shakers of the PR industry, from the "risk communicators" (whose job is to downplay all risks) and "outrage managers" (with their four strategies--deflect, defer, dismiss, or defeat) to those who specialize in "public policy intelligence" (spying on opponents). Evidently, these elaborate PR campaigns are created for our own good. According to public relations philosophers, the public reacts emotionally to topics related to health and safety and is incapable of holding rational discourse. Needless to say, Rampton and Stauber find these views rather antidemocratic and intend to pull back the curtain to reveal the real wizard in Oz. This is one wake-up call that's hard to resist. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>John Stauber is the founder and director of the Center for Media &amp; Democracy.

She is the author of a collection of stories, <i>Gravity</i>, and lives in London.This erudite critical study, together with the Unabridged Diaries of Sylvia Plath released last year, breathes new life into Plath scholarship, ironically in this case through the study of her husband's poetry, particularly Birthday Letters (published in 1998 shortly before his death), which, Wagner, literary editor of the London Times, asserts, "demonstrates the extent to which the poets influenced each other," and then goes on to offer ample evidence, grounding particular poetic images and phrases in specific events of Plath's and Hughes's lives. Hughes's love poetry in Birthday Letters overtly refers to his first meeting of Sylvia at Oxford: "Maybe I noticed you./ .../ Your exaggerated American/ Grin for the cameras, the judges, the strangers, the frighteners." Another poem, about their honeymoon to Spain, notes that "Spain/ was the land of your dreams: the dust-red cadaver/ You dared not wake with...." To understand the complexities of Hughes and Plath's relationship, however, Wagner has had to touch upon one of the literary world's most controversial, and often ugly, disputes: to what degree if any did Hughes contribute to his wife's depression and subsequent suicide at age 30? Fortunately, Wagner is not interested in either launching crude attacks on or apologizing for Hughes. Her clear and careful scholarship allows readers to come to their own conclusions. She encourages readers to stop playing the blame game with these two gifted poets, whose work and lives were undoubtedly influenced by their marriage to each other. In Wagner's own no-nonsense phrasing, her superb study "is an attempt to open up this dialogue between two people both now dead and make [it]... more accessible to the general reader." 8 pages of photos not seen by PW. (Apr.)Forecast: The publication of Birthday Letters created quite a stir. With the recent publication of Plath's unabridged diaries, and Wagner's moderate attitude toward the Plath/Hughes debate, which will undoubtedly be controversial, this could see lively sales. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Temporary kings</h2><p>Trapnel may be dead but his ghost hovers over an American academic&#39;s attempt to rake over the ashes of his affair with Pamela Widmerpool.

It is also a fine tale, well told, of the wild and rowdy side of wildlife work few people know. Fran Hamerstrom&#39;s adventures are hilarious, unique, and even dangerous at times. She has trapped raptors and been raked by their talons. She has dropped a car through the ice not once but three times in an effort to trap and band snowy owls. She has climbed a sky-high beech tree to band an eagle. She has called a police officer a gabboon to his face - and watched him beam with pride. You&#39;ll find out why Fran bakes a dead mouse in her oven. You&#39;ll meet the Rockford Bunch: a clutch of scruffy teenagers who dislike school and who argue about the fine points of some erudite matter such as the juvenile plumage of the Swainson&#39;s hawk. Hamerstrom exclaims: &#39;I&#39;d never met people like this before. Specialized, rowdy scholars - united by their flamboyantly uncouth manners, and above all by their passionate interest in birds of prey.&#39; Joseph J. Hickey, wildlife ecology professor at the University of Wisconsin describes raptor trappers: &#39;Officially, they want to band birds to learn about their weight and moult, their later movements, their longevity, and all that. Underneath, they are unabashed admirers of the wildness, magnificent strength, and awesome flight of creatures at the top of the animal pyramid...they have a youthful zest, and they will endure any hardship and go to any length to catch their birds. Fran is one of these youthful persons. In her own light-hearted way, she portrays here the fascinating development of raptor-trapping techniques in the past few decades, a development in which she played a leading role.&#39;&#34;</p><p></p><h2>In Forest Fields: A Unique Guide to Personal Prayer</h2><p>Written by the internationally best-selling author of &#34;The Garden of Emuna,&#34; this book will definitely improve your relationship with yourself, by putting you in contact with your own soul.

Tour.</p><p>When his town's sleepy summer tranquility is shattered by an outbreak of diphtheria, Jacob Hansen--constable, deacon, and undertaker--stares at an impossible dilemma: save both himself and his family or observe his many duties? Although he's nearly convinced that it's possible to do both, the inexorable and crushing horror of Stewart O'Nan's fifth novel, <i>A Prayer for the Dying</i>, is that evil doesn't flinch, that its insistence can obliterate goodness, corrupt humility. "When won't faith save you?" Jacob wonders; the silence soon deafens him.<p> An ostensibly inured Civil War veteran, Jacob watches helplessly as his neighbors in tiny Friendship, Wisconsin, are stricken with disease: simply hearing a mother say of her daughter, "She's sick," becomes chilling. Yet even as his wife and baby fall ill, Jacob patiently, dutifully tends to the helpless and buries the dead. When panic erupts, however, and he grapples with the tragedies accumulating before him, he feels the prick of spiritual doubt, even succumbs to violence. "Is this the devil's work?" Jacob asks as he struggles to discern the good in a world without order, watches those he serves turn against him, and disregards his own moral outrage.</p><p> O'Nan's style is taut and often oddly lovely, its immediacy braced by an unnerving second-person voice. The novel is, at root, spiritually terrifying. It forces us to consider at what remove we truly are from evil. Overwhelmed with checking his own despair, Jacob begins by pondering how to halt wickedness and ineluctably finds himself sustaining its slow creep. You wonder if he ever had a prayer. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p><b>Stewart O&#x2019;Nan</b>'s novels include <i>Last Night at the Lobster</i>, <i>The Night Country</i>, and <i>Prayer for the Dying</i>.

Some years ago a young, 13 year old eighth grade student from the Fairfield, Iowa Middle School once asked me, "Were you wounded in the war?<br><br> I had been invited to speak in Mrs. Broz's class for many years to talk about my wartime experiences. I had been asked and answered many questions but this one was different. I paused, thought deeply and quickly, and replied.<br><br> "Yes I was wounded, seriously wounded but not a wound that anyone could see and fix." His question gave me pause to quickly think about warriors in all the wars that have been fought, including mine, whose wounds were unseen, untreated and debilitating even though no blood was shed.<br><br> I spent a sleepless night wondering if my answer had satisfied him...or me. What was there about my military service that left me so hopeless and so helpless when I returned home to civilian life? Was it me? The military itself? The combat? This is what I recalled; perhaps the answers would come as I wrote my experiences down.<br><br> "I've been practicing Transcendental Meditation for 40 years.

Now he brings new meaning to the art of autobiography with <i>The Artful Dodger: Images and Reflections,</i> in which he infuses the tale of his professional and artistic life with warmth and wit. <i>The Artful Dodger</i> surveys the vast and varied territory that Bantock's work encompasses: from his English art-school days to paperback covers, pure abstract experimentation to pop-up books, <i>Griffin &amp; Sabine</i> to his most recent work. Bantock's own words lend a highly personal, often revealing, always entertaining angle to more than 350 resplendent images. As rich in life as it is in art, <i>The Artful Dodger</i> reveals the creative range of a modern graphic master.</p><p>As 3 million readers can attest, Nick Bantock's Griffin and Sabine trilogy is the world's most original epistolary novel. It contains (physically contains) the correspondence of Londoner Griffin Moss and Sabine Strohem of the Sicmon Islands in the South Pacific--colorful postcards and letters in envelopes pasted into the book, which the reader must open and read. In his gloriously illustrated autobiography <i>The Artful Dodger</i>, Bantock explains the allure of opening letters: it's "a sort of cross between Christmas and sex." And when the letters illuminate somebody else's mysterious love affair, it's all the more delicious.<p> Griffin and Sabine really are mysterious, and it's tricky to piece together their story from the fanciful, surrealistic bits the text, maps, stamps, and pictures provide. That's why fans will be ravenous to read Bantock's charmingly straightforward memoir, which lets us in on all kinds of secrets about his symbols and visual sources. Winged figures always signify transition, he says, "whether on a monkey, an angel, or a devil." Sabine's Sicmon Islands home derives from the English expression "sick as a parrot," which connects with the parrot on the first book's cover and expresses Griffin's ailing English soul--what he needs is a sensual, elusive Sabine to get his blood up. Both characters are warring parts of Bantock's own psyche.</p><p> You don't need to know a thing about them to revel in this book. It's spellbinding in its own right, partly for the artless narrative, but mostly for the hundreds of pictures and the fascinating intricacy of Bantock's creative process. Sabine done in ghostly charcoal and gold dust is exquisite, no matter who she might be. It's a bit spooky to learn that a 1970s French stamp Bantock bought from his local shop to go with one of Sabine's postcards turns out to have been classified as "Type Sabine" by the French Philatelic Society. It was taken from a David painting of the Sabine women, and was meant to symbolize "union"--the central theme of Bantock's trilogy. </p><p> There is plenty besides his greatest hit to delight the eye here. The book cover illustrations are arresting, particularly for Peter Ackroyd's bio <i>Chatterton</i> (though his depiction of T.S. Eliot's <i>The Waste Land</i> is drably silly). His pop-up books of <i>Jabberwocky</i> and <i>The Egyptian Jukebox</i> (a series of drawers full of museum-like objects that tell the tale of a mad millionaire's travels) are brilliant. Bantock's gift for collage does honor to his idol, Joseph Cornell, without being derivative. His wildly improbable life story proves that fate shares his enthusiasm for flights of fancy. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Nick Bantock is the author of numerous illustrated novels, including Griffin &amp; Sabine, Sabine's Notebook, The Golden Mean, The Gryphon, and Alexandria, which together spent 100 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.

Cherryh&#39;s Del Rey debut--the story of Rusalka, the ghost of a murdered girl still seeking to exist by drawing the energy of life from all nearby living things, and the attempt to bring her back to life by her father Ulamets, and Pyetr, the young man who loved her.A Rusalka--the spirit of a maiden drowned by accident or force--will return as a ghost to haunt the river and woods where she met her death. The locale for this fantasy by SF writer Cherryh ( Downbelow Station ) is pre-Christian Russia. Two young men flee the village of Vojvoda--Pyetr, accused of killing a wealthy noble, and Sasha, an accessory to his escape. They are making their way to Kiev when, in the middle of a forest, they become involved in the search for the wizard Uulamets's dead daughter Eveshka, a Rusalka and a wizard herself. Uulamets wants to resurrect her, but evil forces oppose him, among whom may be Kavi Chernevog, Uulamets's former student, and a suspect in Eveshka's death. Cherryh fills her story with myriad magical creatures from Slavonic mythology. A richness of detail and characterization enliven this drama about the human (and unhuman) greed for power and the redemptive power of love. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Dwarf</h2><p>"I have noticed that sometimes I frighten people; what they really fear is themselves. They think it is I who scare them, but it is the dwarf within them, the ape-faced manlike being who sticks up his head from the depths of their souls."<br><br>P�r Lagerkvist's richly philosophical novel <i>The Dwarf</i> is an exploration of individual and social identity. The novel, set in a time when Italian towns feuded over the outcome of the last feud, centers on a social outcast, the court dwarf PIccoline. From his special vantage point Piccoline comments on the court's prurience and on political intrigue as the town is gripped by a siege. Gradually, Piccoline is drawn deeper and deeper into the conflict, and he inspires fear and hate around him as he grows to represent the fascination of the masses with violence.<br></p><p><b>P�r </b>Lagerkvist, playwright, poet, essayist, and novelist, received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1951. <i>The Dwarf</i>, long considered a masterpiece of modern literature, was first published in 1945.

It is only when the Brother in charge of the account books dies unexpectedly that an explanation is revealed: large amounts of money had been paid for goods the college never received. Although shocked by this evidence of fraud, Matthew Bartholomew is more concerned with the disappearance of a quantity of pennyroyal from his herbarium. Pennyroyal is known to cause a woman to miscarry, and a pregnant visitor to his sister's household has died from an overdose of the substance. Had she meant to abort her child, or had someone else wanted to ensure that she was unable to provide an heir to her husband's wealthy estates? When Matthew learns that it was the dead woman&#x2019;s husband who had received Michaelhouse's missing money, he begins to search for other connections and quickly exposes a deep and treacherous conspiracy.</p></p><p><p>Susanna Gregory is a Cambridge academic&nbsp;and the author of the Thomas Chaloner series.</p>The many characters, murders and possible motivations tend to overwhelm Gregory's 15th Matthew Bartholomew chronicle (after 2008's <i>The Devil's Disciples</i>). Late one night in 1357, Bartholomew, a doctor associated with Cambridge's Michaelhouse College, receives a summons to attend an ailing pregnant woman, Joan Elyan. Despite his ministrations, Elyan dies, apparently from a dose of a medicine used to end pregnancy. To Bartholomew's horror, he finds that the drugs may have come from his own stores. The physician is further dismayed to learn of evidence of embezzlement from Michaelhouse by a trusted friend, who dies before he can be confronted. Several more deaths, the theft of some precious chalices and a brother-sister pair of villains who believe Michaelhouse has something that belongs to them complicate an already complicated plot. Still, Bartholomew remains a credible and sympathetic amateur sleuth. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An advertising executive, infatuated with a girl who possesses the most perfect ears (an erotic charge for him) uses a picture of a sheep with a star on its back. This catapults him into a weird adventure to find the mythical sheep up in the wilds of Hokkaido, Japan&#39;s northern island. There are strange encounters, a hotel with an extra disappearing floor, and other oddities. &#34;A Wild Sheep Chase&#34; is an early Murakami work, but its remarkable and individual voice makes it one of the most thrilling of his books. It is superbly read by Rupert Degas with an edge of Raymond Chandler.</p><p>A marvelous hybrid of mythology and mystery, A Wild Sheep Chase" is the extraordinary literary thriller that launched Haruki Murakami's international reputation. <br>It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company's advertisement. What he doesn't realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, A Wild Sheep Chase is Murakami at his astounding best.&#x201c;Murakami is a mythmaker for the millennium, a wiseacre wiseman.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>New York Times Book Review <br><br></i>"A delight . . . equal parts screwball comedy, detective story, and heroic quest." &#x2013;<i>USA Today</i><br>&#x201c;A witty adventure . . . a piece of verbal anarchy . . . a labyrinthine mystery from start to finish.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle<br></i><br>"Marvelously engaging, at turns witty, dry, wicked, even loopy.

Here's one possible source. Bartle Bull, a lawyer, publisher, explorer, and writer, centers his latest thriller at the Cataract Cafe, a floating version of Rick's in 1935 Cairo. The owner, Olivio, is a dwarf from Goa, and his regular customers include a stalwart British professional hunter, his unfaithful wife and her lover, an Italian aviator, American twin sisters in search of all kinds of adventure, and various rogue Germans, including a doctor who regrets not being able to use Olivio for medical research. Bull's writing is wry and deceptively simple: <blockquote> The waiter set before the doctor a glass of warm boiled water and the flesh of a Nile perch, cleaned from the bone and rearranged on the plate in the shape of a smaller fish. The water was pink from the three spoonfuls of vinegar that had been stirred into it, the day's first weapon in his battle with arthritis. The German leaned forward. His high hooked nose hung over the table like a chimney over a fireplace as he widened his nostrils and smelled the fish. </blockquote> Outside the cafe, larger forces are at work: Mussolini is helping to start World War II with his attacks on Abyssinia, and other countries are jockeying for power. By focusing on the lives of a few assorted cafe goers, Bull makes his book add up to much more than a hill of beans--he gives us a rich, exciting picture of a world about to disappear. <i>--Dick Adler</i><p><strong>Bartle Bull</strong> is the author of the widely praised African novels <em>The White Rhino Hotel</em>, <em>A Cafe on the Nile</em>, and <em>The Devil's Oasis</em>.

He regularly stood at the operating table for ten hours at a time, but at the end of his shift his face would not show the slightest signs of fatigue, and as he walked back to our apartment his steps were loud and firm. Nearing home, he would often take a pee by the corner of the alley outside. His urine would splash noisily on the wall, like a sudden downpour of rain.<br>&nbsp;<br>When my father was twenty-five years old, he married a pretty young worker from the textile mill, and in their second year of marriage she gave him a son, my older brother, and two years later she had another son, who was me.<br>&nbsp;<br>When I was eight, the vigorous surgeon happened to get a day off from his usual hectic schedule. He enjoyed the luxury of sleeping all morning at home, and in the afternoon he went for a long walk with his sons and played with them on the beach for hours. On the way home he let one ride on his shoulders and carried the other in his arms. By the time they had finished dinner it was already dark, and he, his wife, and their two children sat underneath the parasol tree that stood outside their door. At that hour the moonlight shone down, casting the leaves&#x2019; mottled shadows over us, and a cool breeze rustled.<br>&nbsp;<br>The surgeon lay on a makeshift bamboo lounge chair, his wife sat in an adjacent rattan chair, and my brother and I sat next to each other on a bench. We listened as our father explained how everyone had an appendix in their belly and how every day he had to remove, at the very least, twenty or so appendixes. His fastest time was just fifteen minutes&#x2014;fifteen minutes to perform the operation and cut off the appendix. We asked him what he did with it afterward.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Afterward . . . &#x201d; my father waved his hand dismissively. &#x201c;Afterward we throw it away.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;An appendix isn&#x2019;t worth a fart,&#x201d; he answered.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then he had a question for us. &#x201c;What are the lungs for?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;For breathing in,&#x201d; my brother replied.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;What else?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother thought for a moment: &#x201c;And breathing out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And the tummy? What&#x2019;s the tummy for?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The tummy? The tummy digests things you have eaten.&#x201d; Again it was my brother who answered.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And the heart?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>This time I beat him to it. &#x201c;The heart beats, thump thump!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My father glanced at me. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s true, you&#x2019;re both right. The lungs, the stomach, the heart, as well as the duodenum, the colon, the large intestine, the rectum, and whatnot&#x2014;they all have their various functions. It&#x2019;s just the appendix, the appendix at the end of the cecum . . . Do you know what the appendix is good for?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother had the answer ready. &#x201c;The appendix isn&#x2019;t worth a fart.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My father laughed and our mother, sitting next to him, laughed too. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; my father continued, &#x201c;the appendix isn&#x2019;t good for anything. When you breathe, when you digest your meals, when you&#x2019;re sleeping, none of these activities involves the appendix in the slightest. Even when you eat so much that you burp or have a tummyache and give a fart, this doesn&#x2019;t have anything to do with your appendix either.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother and I tittered when we heard our father talking about burping and farting. Then he sat up. &#x201c;But if the appendix gets inflamed,&#x201d; he told us gravely, &#x201c;the tummy will ache more and more, and if the appendix is perforated it will cause peritonitis, and that can be fatal. Fatal, you understand what that means?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother nodded. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll kill you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I gasped when I heard that. Seeing my reaction, my father patted me on the head. &#x201c;Actually, removal of the appendix is a minor procedure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So long as there&#x2019;s no perforation, there&#x2019;s no danger&nbsp;. . . There was a British surgeon&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>As my father spoke, he lay back in his chair. We knew he was going to tell a story. He closed his eyes and gave a contented yawn, then turned to face us. He said that one day the British surgeon arrived on a little island. This little island had no hospital and no doctor and not even a medical kit, but his appendix became inflamed and he lay underneath a palm tree, racked with pain for a whole morning. He knew if there was any further delay in operating, his appendix would perforate&nbsp;. . .<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;And what happens if the appendix perforates?&#x201d; My father propped himself up.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be a goner,&#x201d; my brother said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It will turn into peritonitis, and then he&#x2019;ll be a goner,&#x201d; my father corrected him.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The British surgeon had no choice but to operate on himself,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;He had two natives hold up a big mirror and, looking at himself in the mirror, in this particular spot&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My father pointed at the right side of his stomach. &#x201c;In this very spot he made an incision in the skin, pushed the fat aside, put his hand in, searched for the cecum&#x2014;you need to find that first before you can find the appendix&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A British surgeon operating on himself: this incredible story left us spellbound. We looked at our father, our eyes gleaming, and asked him if he could operate on himself too, just like the British surgeon.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That depends on the situation,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;If I was on that little island and my appendix was inflamed, to save my own life I would operate on myself too.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Father&#x2019;s reply made the blood flow hot in our veins. We had always thought him to be the strongest, most capable man in the world, and his answer further confirmed us in this belief. It also gave us the confidence to brag to the other boys. &#x201c;Our Dad operates on himself,&#x201d; I would say. &#x201c;The two of us hold up a big mirror,&#x201d; my brother would add, pointing at me.<br>&nbsp;<br>That&#x2019;s how the next couple of months passed. In the autumn of that year, our father&#x2019;s appendix became inflamed. It was a Sunday morning. Our mother was about to go off to the factory to put in some overtime when our father returned from the night shift. He came in the door just as she was leaving. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get any sleep at all last night,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;There was a head injury, two fractures, and a penicillin toxicosis. I&#x2019;m so worn out, my body&#x2019;s aching.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Patting his chest, he lay down on his bed to sleep. My brother and I were in the other room. We put the table on top of the chairs, and then put the chairs on top of the table; three or four hours passed as we moved the furniture around this way and that. When we heard our father groaning in his room, we went over and put our ears to the door. After a moment we realized he was calling our names, so we pushed the door open and went in. We found him curled up like a shrimp, looking at us with clenched teeth. &#x201c;My appendix&nbsp;. . . ,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Ahhh!&nbsp;. . . it&#x2019;s killing me&nbsp;. . . acute appendicitis. Hurry up and go to the hospital. Ask for Dr. Chen&nbsp;. . . or Dr. Wang would do&nbsp;. . . quickly, go&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother grabbed me by the hand and we went downstairs, out the door, and along the alley. Now I realized what was happening. Father&#x2019;s appendix was inflamed, and we were going to the hospital to fetch Dr. Chen or Dr. Wang. Once we&#x2019;d found them, what would they do?<br>&nbsp;<br>When I thought of Father&#x2019;s appendix all inflamed, my heart pounded. I thought to myself: So, at last, Father&#x2019;s appendix is inflamed. Now he can operate on himself, and my brother and I can hold up the big mirror.<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother stopped when we reached the end of the alley. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t go and fetch Dr. Chen, nor Dr. Wang either.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Well, look, if we find them, they&#x2019;ll do an operation.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I nodded. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to see Dad operate on himself?&#x201d; my brother asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Yes, that is what I want,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;So we can&#x2019;t look for Dr. Chen or Dr. Wang. We&#x2019;ll go to the operating theater and nab a surgical kit. As for the big mirror, we have one of those at home&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>I was so happy I shouted. &#x201c;Yes! This way we can let Dad do the operation himself.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When we got to the hospital, practically all the staff was having lunch in the cafeteria and there was just one nurse in the operating theater. My brother told me to chat her up, so I went over and called her Auntie and asked her how she could possibly be so pretty. As she smiled and simpered, my brother stole a surgical kit.<br>&nbsp;<br>Then we went back home. Father heard us come in. &#x201c;Dr. Chen, Dr. Chen! Is that you, Dr. Wang?&#x201d; he called in a low voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>We went into his room. Father&#x2019;s forehead was bathed in sweat. The pain was getting to him. He could see there was no Dr. Chen, and no Dr. Wang either, just his two sons, my brother and me. &#x201c;What about Dr. Chen? Why isn&#x2019;t Dr. Chen here?&#x201d; he asked hoarsely.<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother told me to open the surgical kit, while he brought over the big mirror our mother used to check her outfit each morning. Father didn&#x2019;t know what we were up to. &#x201c;And Dr. Wang?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Dr. Wang wasn&#x2019;t there either?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>We laid out the surgical kit on Father&#x2019;s right. I clambered on top of the bed and together we lifted up the mirror. My brother made a point of leaning forward and taking a peek in the mirror, to check that Father could see himself clearly. &#x201c;Dad, get on with it!&#x201d; we said excitedly.<br>&nbsp;<br>By now he was in such pain, his features were contorted. Gasping, he stared at us, still peppering us with questions about Dr. Chen and Dr. Wang. We were getting desperate. &#x201c;Dad, hurry up,&#x201d; we cried. &#x201c;Otherwise it will get perforated!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hurry up&nbsp;. . . with what?&#x201d; he asked, weakly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Dad, hurry up and operate!&#x201d; we said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, finally, he understood. He glared at us. &#x201c;You bastards!&#x201d; he cursed.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was shocked, not knowing what we&#x2019;d done wrong, and looked inquiringly at my brother, who was equally taken aback. Father was in such agony he couldn&#x2019;t speak, and he stared at us in silence. Returning his gaze, my brother realized at last why Father had cursed us. &#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t taken Dad&#x2019;s pants off yet,&#x201d; he said.<br>&nbsp;<br>My brother had me hold the mirror while he tried to pull down Dad&#x2019;s pants, but our father slapped him across the face and, straining with effort, cursed us again. &#x201c;Bastards!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>This frightened my brother so much that he scurried off the bed, and I followed suit, quickly crawling over Dad&#x2019;s legs and onto the floor. We stood there side by side, looking at him as he lay there in a powerless rage. &#x201c;Can it be Dad doesn&#x2019;t want to do the operation?&#x201d; I asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Tears welled up in our father&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;Be good boys,&#x201d; he moaned, struggling to get his words out. &#x201c;Hurry&nbsp;. . . hurry and fetch&nbsp;. . . Mom. Tell Mom to come&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>We&#x2019;d been hoping Father would operate on himself like a hero, and now here he was, crying! We looked at him a moment longer, and then my brother took my hand and we ran out the door, down the stairs and along the full length of the alley. This time we didn&#x2019;t think up our own plan of action&#x2014;we went to fetch Mom.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the time our father was carried into the operating theater, his appendix was perforated and his stomach was filled with pus. He developed peritonitis and had to spend weeks and weeks in a hospital bed, and then convalesce at home for another month before he could again don a white smock and resume his job as doctor. But he could never again be a surgeon, for his energy was spent: if he were to stand at the operating table for an hour he would grow faint and his eyes would blur. He had gone thin overnight and never regained the weight he lost. When he walked, there was no longer that spring to his stride, and though he might take a big first step he would only go half as far with his second. When winter came, he seemed to have a constant cold. So from then on he could be only a doctor of internal medicine, and he would sit at a desk every day, chatting idly with the patients, scrawling routine prescriptions. After he got off work he would walk slowly homeward, rubbing his hands with a cotton ball soaked in alcohol.

Afterword.<br></p><p>Cheryl Whitesel is the author of REBEL: A TIBETAN ODYSSEY, published by HarperCollins Books for Children in 2001 to excellent reviews. She lives in Western Springs, IL.The next morning, Spider laid out the sketchy map of the castle on the grass. Add anything you noticed,&#x201d; he commanded. Koji gazed at the paper in silence. If Spider would like to know about anything he saw, surely he would most like to know about the new weapon. But what good would it do him to reveal the musket now? Yet there might come a time when the information would be precious.<br> Koji touched his arm where Spider had cut it. Clear Mist had bandaged the wound the night before, but it was still sore. Why do you want to know what I saw in the castle, anyway?&#x201d; Koji asked, although he thought he knew the answer. Why do you think?&#x201d; Koji was disgusted. He had hidden his firecrackers in one of the storeroom caves, but he wished he had them now. He wanted to light one and push it up Spider&#x2019;s nose. You were in the castle with me, hidden somewhere,&#x201d; he said. So think for yourself what the layout is like. I won&#x2019;t help you.&#x201d; It took all his courage to roll the map shut. Think hard before you make threats you are powerless to carry out,&#x201d; said a rasping voice from behind. Koji and Spider spun around together. Dark Fire sat on a nearby stump with his walking sticks on the ground beside him. On his knee, he balanced his pet cricket in its bamboo cage. He held one end of a long thread. The other end was tied around the leg of a crow with clipped wings. It hopped around, pecking at the ground. Koji and Spider waited for Dark Fire&#x2019;s attention while he gave the string a harsh tug. He chuckled over the crow&#x2019;s antics as, cawing, it fell and fluttered its wings in a panic. After it finally calmed down, Dark Fire tugged the string again. I am becoming impatient with you, farm boy,&#x201d; he told Koji. He kept pulling the glossy bird closer. When it was near, he gently slid open the door of his pet cricket&#x2019;s cage. He tipped it up slightly and the cricket slid out onto the grass in front of the crow.<br> For a moment, the crow and cricket both stood motionless. Then the crow jerked its head forward and snapped up Dark Fire&#x2019;s beloved pet. With a twitching leg sticking out of its beak, the bird hopped away. Its head bobbed as it swallowed.<br> Dark Fire slid shut the door of the empty cricket cage. He folded his hands and turned back to Koji, who was stiff with horror. Dark Fire&#x2019;s eyes were flares as he rasped, Unroll the map.&#x201d; Koji was afraid to disobey, yet his hands were paralyzed. It is time for you to become one of us.&#x201d; I&#x2019;ll try to be like you,&#x201d; Koji said with a frantic bow.<br> Dark Fire looked down at his walking sticks. Not like me. You are young and strong enough to complete missions, so you will begin as a genin like my grandson.&#x201d; He motioned toward Spider. Forgive my impoliteness at suggesting that I could be like you, our leader,&#x201d; Koji said, still trying to please the old man.<br> But Dark Fire&#x2019;s cheek twitched in irritation. Groveling disgusts me. And I am not the true clan leader the jonin. His identity is secret.&#x201d; But you alone communicate with him, Grand-father,&#x201d; Spider said proudly.<br> That is my role as the number-one chunin.&#x201d; Looking down at his weak legs, Dark Fire sighed. After all, I cannot be a training master like the other chunin.&#x201d; Koji glanced at the empty cricket cage and the tame crow nearby. It hopped around, trying to bite off the string that was tied around its leg and snaked across the ground toward Dark Fire. Then he scanned the clearing full of people. Does our jonin live here in the camp? he wondered. Does he know me? But he glanced at the tail of the string, near Dark Fire&#x2019;s foot, and didn&#x2019;t dare ask. Dark Fire seemed to guess Koji&#x2019;s thoughts. You are unwise to wonder who our jonin is,&#x201d; he said. Now draw!&#x201d; While Dark Fire watched, Koji forced his trembling hand to draw a few rooms, stairways, and large jars on the map. He pointed out the hall where O Kei had talked about a network of threads. But he paused before drawing the secrecy room, and as he held his hand motionless, Dark Fire nodded his approval. You will be a ninja until the day you die,&#x201d; Dark Fire said, and Koji laid down the brush. If Dark Fire was satisfied with what he had already drawn, perhaps it was safest to stop. Continue being forthright with me and your death day may remain distant.&#x201d; Dark Fire gazed at Koji&#x2019;s bandaged arm. When Koji didn&#x2019;t explain the injury, the old man said, Spend today with my grandson. If you learn a few things from him, tomorrow&#x2019;s challenge may be eased slightly. You see, you are ready to begin training.&#x201d; Training? I don&#x2019;t want &#x201d; Dark Fire held up his hand for silence. How long will you remain a bird who walks everywhere on its scrawny legs, never daring to try its wings? You will bbegin training tomorrow, whether you wish it or not. However, before you start, let me caution you that mastery of weapons and your arms and legs wwwwwill only take you so far along the ninjutsu path. Our way is more about caring for each other, compassion, integrity.&#x201d; Dark Fire reached down for the end of the string. When he snapped it ever so slightly, the crow hopped and fluttered its way back to him. You see, competence and wisdom are found on different life journeys. One does not lead to the other.&#x201d; Is that what I want?&#x201d; Koji murmured. Wisdom?&#x201d; As if the crow were a baby, Dark Fire reached down and lifted it in his arms. It&#x2019;s what you should want.&#x201d; He motioned for Spider to take over with Koji and hobbled away with the crow perched on his shoulder. Watch this.&#x201d; Grinning, Spider picked up the map of the castle, folded it in half, and tore it down the middle.<br> What are you doing?&#x201d; Koji cried.<br> Don&#x2019;t you realize we know every inch of the castle? We didn&#x2019;t wonder about the castle at all, but we needed to test how you would respond when we asked for your help. Would you tell us the truth about what you saw or try to mislead us? Didn&#x2019;t you guess that your assignment was not what it seemed?&#x201d; No. How did I do?&#x201d; Come on, let&#x2019;s fight.&#x201d; With his chest puffed out importantly, Spider hoisted Koji up and pushed him to one of the sparring circles. He sprang into the air as flexibly as a shadow, raised his fists as he landed, and began hitting out to warm up. Dancing just out of reach, he lightly slapped Koji&#x2019;s cheeks. Come on, peppercorn, show me your spice!&#x201d; No!&#x201d; But Koji struck out with both fists. The right connected, but it didn&#x2019;t slow Spider, whose fist exploded in Koji&#x2019;s face. Koji fell and sat dazed. Blood dripped into his mouth. Gulping, he pinched his nostrils together. Weak little paddy frog,&#x201d; Spider muttered, kicking at Koji. He drew in a breath, then placed the sole of his left foot up against the inside of his right knee. With the palms of his hands together, he raised his arms over his head and stood motionless. He chanted under his breath with his eyes turned upward, then let his head fall onto his chest. He sprang out of position. You&#x2019;re not ready for tomorrow,&#x201d; he warned Koji before trotting away.<br> Koji sat down near a scaling wall and, feeling glum, watched Raven Wing, Minnow, and Sky swarm up and down. Helped by clawlike pieces of metal strapped to their hands, they looked as comfortable as flies on the vertical surface. Will Dark Fire expect me to do such impossible things? he wondered anxiously. Koji.&#x201d; He turned to find Falcon kneeling behind him, looking as if he wanted to talk. But Spider ran up and grabbed Falcon by the shoulder as if to pull him away. Shaking him off, Falcon cast an indulgent smile up at him. It won&#x2019;t hurt if I talk to him, Spider. You don&#x2019;t understand how he feels.&#x201d; Gently, he added, Koji, things will go easier for you if you accept being here.&#x201d; Koji gazed at Falcon, realizing that if any ninja could become a trusted friend, it was him. He snatched a leaf off the ground and tore it to pieces. I can&#x2019;t I should be with my family.&#x201d; See? He says he refuses,&#x201d; Spider said as he sauntered off. Falcon, you&#x2019;ll make him soft!&#x201d; He snorted over his shoulder.<br> You say you want to be with your family,&#x201d; Falcon said to Koji. Don&#x2019;t you realize that if you ever see them again . . .&#x201d; Don&#x2019;t say if&#x2019;!&#x201d; When, then. Won&#x2019;t they be impressed to see you changed so strong and competent?&#x201d; Koji glanced up, shocked and interested. He remembered a time, years ago, when a traveling peddler had been surprised to learn that he and Taro were twins; he assumed Koji was younger.<br> No,&#x201d; Papa had said. Koji is moments older. But he&#x2019;s immature compared to his brother, and that fools you. Look, can&#x2019;t you see that they&#x2019;re exactly the same height?&#x201d; Later that night, Papa and Mama murmured together, glancing at the twins now and then. Finally, Papa announced, In the past, I&#x2019;ve told you to try to act more grown up, Koji. But never mind. This way is best. Perhaps superstitious strangers won&#x2019;t even guess that you&#x2019;re twins.&#x201d; Now as he gazed at Falcon, Koji wondered what it would be like to go home as a trained warrior, to meet strangers who assumed he was older than Taro. I don&#x2019;t know whether . . . ,&#x201d; Koji began. But was Falcon really someone in whom he could confide? He took in a deep breath. I don&#x2019;t know whether my family could ever be proud of me again. I did . . . something bad.&#x201d; Mistakes are normal. Part of being alive.&#x201d; But I let down my whole family.&#x201d; Still, Koji, it&#x2019;s a hard heart that won&#x2019;t give the person he hurt a chance to forgive him.&#x201d;<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Cheryl Aylward Whitesel.

In <em>Out of the Fog</em>, Dr. Kevin R. Murphy, Chief of the Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, and medical writer Suzanne LeVert give adult ADD patients and their families everything they need to understand and live with ADD, including practical advice on how to cope with its symptoms and current methods for treating this often debilitating condition.

Murphy, Ph.D.</strong>, is Chief of the Adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts. He is a member of the advisory board of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders (CH.A.D.D.), which is the leading ADD organization in America, with over 25,000 members. Dr. Murphy has written extensively on the subject for professional publications and regularly speaks to and conducts workshops for professionals and lay audiences across the country. He lives in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.<br><br> <strong>Suzanne LeVert</strong> is a health and medical writer with seven health care titles to her credit. She lives in Boston.Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), is the diagnosis given heretofore to the "overactive" child who acted out in school, got poor grades, and couldn't sit still. Three decades ago, such children were often held back in school and thought to be lacking in self-control. Two decades ago, it was found that the stimulant Ritalin inexplicably calmed hyperactive children. It was believed that they eventually "grew out of it," usually by puberty. However, new research suggests that they do not grow out of ADD but instead learn to adapt and struggle with the disorder well into adulthood. Two new books address this premise. Wender (The Hyperactive Child, Adolescent, and Adult, Oxford Univ. Pr., 1987), professor of psychiatry and Director of Psychiatric Research at the University of Utah School of Medicine, has written Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder for professionals, but informed lay readers will appreciate the case histories. In thorough, if quite technical manner, Wender synthesizes the overlapping research and possible relationships between ADHD and learning disorders, as well as alcohol abuse as those afflicted try to self-medicate. Out of the Fog, written by the chief of the Adult ADHD Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, is written for a popular audience and could serve to "self-diagnose" readers by using "Self-Exploration Exercises." Murphy also gives lists for simplifying and improving life for the adult with ADD, using concrete examples of time management and organizational skills. Written from a personal perspective (Murphy also has ADHD), it provides much insight into the world of the hyperactive adult. Both books are highly recommended.?Nina Wikstrom Aguilar, Melbourne, Fla.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Salt of the Earth: The Church at the End of the Millennium- An Interview With Peter Seewald</h2><p>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, well-known Vatican prelate and head of the Congregation on the Doctrine of the Faith, gives a full-length interview to secular journalist Peter Seewald, on a host of controversial and difficult issues facing Catholicism and Christianity at the end of the millennium.

For now, these make lovely gifts that are sure to please--and note that the peanut butter is interchangeable with an equal amount of almond butter, or any other nut butter that tickles your fancy.</p> <p><em>Makes about 100 bite-size candies</em></p> <p><b>Special Equipment</b></p> <ul> <li>Heatproof spatula</li> <li>3 plastic piping bags or gallon-size zip-top bags</li> <li>Kitchen scissors</li> <li>100 small foil candy cups</li> <li>2 large (13" x 18") rimmed baking sheets, lined with parchment or wax paper</li> </ul> <p><b>Ingredients for the Peanut Butter Filling</b></p> <ul> <li>7 1/2 ounces (225 g) white chocolate, chopped (about 1 1/4 cups)</li> <li>1/4 cup (60 g) heavy (whipping) cream</li> <li>1 tablespoon (25 g) light corn syrup</li> <li>3/4 cup (135 g) creamy commercial peanut butter, such as Skippy</li> <li>1 teaspoon (5 g) kosher salt</li> </ul> <p><b>Ingredients for the Chocolate Cups and Garnish</b></p> <ul> <li>4 cups (26 ounces/740 g) chopped dark chocolate, or 4 cups (26 ounces/740 g) chopped dark chocolate and 2/3 cup(150 g) mild vegetable oil</li> <li>2/3 cup (175 g) seedless raspberry jam</li> <li>Maldon sea salt or fleur de sel</li> </ul> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>1. Make the peanut butter filling: In a medium-size microwave-safe bowl, microwave the white chocolate in 15-second intervals, stirring between each with the heatproof spatuala, until it has softened to the touch (it doesn&#x2019;t need to be melted). (Alternatively, soften it in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water.) Set aside.</p> <p>2. Combine the cream and corn syrup in a small (1-quart) saucepan, and cook over medium heat until the mixture is steaming and bubbles are just starting to form around the edge. Remove the pan from the heat and pour the cream mixture over the white chocolate. Allow it to sit for 1 minute; then stir with the spatula until all the white chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth.</p> <p>3. Stir in the peanut butter and kosher salt. Transfer the filling to the piping bag and snip a hole 1/2 inch from the tip; set it aside in a bowl.</p> <p>4. Make the chocolate for lining the cups: Temper the 4 cups chocolate according to the instructions on page 26, or use the 4 cups chocolate and 2/3 cup oil to make Cheater&#x2019;s Chocolate Coating as directed on page 32. Transfer the prepared chocolate to a piping bag and snip a hole 1/4 inch from the tip; set it aside in a bowl.</p> <p>5. Set half of the foil cups on one of the prepared baking sheets. Working with 10 cups at a time, pipe the chocolate into the cups, filling them halfway. Then, starting with the first cup, tilt each cup to coat the inside completely, and pour the excess chocolate back into the bowl. Turn the coated cups upside down on the baking sheet and let them stand for 30 seconds. Turn the cups right side up and transfer them to the second baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining foil cups. Allow the coated cups to set until the chocolate is firm, 10 minutes.</p> <p>6. When the peanut butter filling is no longer warm but still pipes easily, pipe it into each cup to fill it about halfway. (If the peanut butter filling hardens slightly, microwave the bag on High for 3 to 5 seconds and knead it thoroughly. Or place the piping bag in a bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water and gently knead it after 30 seconds. Repeat as needed until the mixture pipes easily.)</p> <p>7. Fill the remaining piping bag with the jam and snip a hole 1/2-inch from the tip. Pipe a generous 1/2 teaspoon of jam over the filling in each cup, being careful to avoid getting jam on the rim (which will prevent the top layer of chocolate from properly adhering to the cup).</p> <p>8. Pipe the remaining chocolate on top of the jam to fill each cup completely. Tap the bottom of each cup gently against the baking sheet to level the chocolate. Top with a few flakes of Maldon salt. Let the filled cups stand until firm to the touch, about 15 minutes.</p> <p>Store the PB&amp;J Cups in an airtight container for up to 1 week.</p> <p><em>Download a PDF of this recipe.</em></p>Liz Gutman and Jen King became friends while attending the French Culinary Institute&#x2019;s pastry program.

Montgomery wrote nine detective novels and two collections of short stories under the pseudonym Edmund Crispin (taken from a character in Michael Innes&#x2019;s Hamlet, Revenge!). The stories feature Oxford don Gervase Fen, who is a Professor of English at the University and a fellow of St Christopher&#x2019;s College, a fictional institution that Crispin locates next to St John&#x2019;s College. The whodunit novels have complex plots and fantastic, somewhat unbelievable solutions, including examples of the locked room mystery.

Among these strips are the first appearance of many long-time Dick Tracy characters, such as Tess Truehart, Junior and Chief Brandon.

He attended Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State University) before transferring to Northwestern University in Chicago, from which he graduated in 1923. He produced the minor comic strips&nbsp;<i>Fillum Fables</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Radio Catts&nbsp;</i>before striking it big with&nbsp;<i>Dick Tracy</i>&nbsp;in 1931. Originally titled&nbsp;<i>Plainclothes Tracy</i>, the rechristened strip became one of the most successful and lauded comic strips of all time, as well as a media and merchandising sensation. He was twice accorded the &#x201c;Cartoonist of the Year&#x201d; Reuben Award by his peers. Gould continued to write and illustrate&nbsp;<i>Dick Tracy</i>&nbsp;until his retirement in 1977.<i>Dick Tracy</i>'s pop-cultural profile has receded since Warren Beatty's flop movie adaptation. Whereas 700 newspapers once carried the strip, it now appears in only about 50. But here the venerable comic-strip detective receives the kind of handsomely mounted representation in chronology that <i>Peanuts, Dennis the Menace,</i> and <i>Gasoline Alley</i> currently enjoy. The inaugural volume in this effort to completely reprint creator Gould's 46-year run contains the first strips published from October 1931 to May 1933. The artwork is initially crude even by the standards of the day, and the plotlines are mundane. Tracy comes up against petty mobsters--the main villain here is Big Boy, an Al Capone takeoff--rather than the evil grotesques that would become the strip's staple. The stories have the unassuming verve and period charm of precode gangster movies, and within six months, Gould's art evolves into a prototype of his signature style. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Owners name is also on endpaper. 8.5x5.5 with 242 pp.</p><p>"I am not a naturalist. I never was and never will be a naturalist." So Ed Abbey opens <i>The Journey Home</i>, a collection of essays that turns every page or two to some aspect of the natural history of the desert West. Abbey had recently been compared to Henry Thoreau as a writer who had made a home both literary and real in the wild, and he was having none of it: he wanted to be thought of as a novelist and environmental activist, not as the author of gentle essays on self-sufficiency and the turn of the seasons. <i>The Journey Home</i> is thus full of politically charged, often enraged essays on such matters as urban growth ("The Blob Comes to Arizona"), the gentrification of the small-town West ("Telluride Blues--A Hatchet Job"), and wilderness preservation ("Let Us Now Praise Mountain Lions"). He raised a few hackles with this book, but he also found many devoted readers, fans who wanted and got an update of and rejoinder to Abbey's <i>Desert Solitaire</i>. Agree with him or not, you can't fault Abbey for his honest self-assessment: "I am--really am--an extremist," he wrote, "one who lives and loves by choice far out on the very verge of things, on the edge of the abyss, where this world falls into the depths of the other. That's the way I like it." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i><b>Edward Abbey</b>, a self-proclaimed &#x201c;agrarian anarchist,&#x201d; was hailed as the &#x201c;Thoreau of the American West.&#x201d; Known nationally as a champion of the individual and one of this country&#x2019;s foremost defenders of the natural environment, he was the author of twenty books, both fiction and nonfiction, including <i>Desert Solitaire, The Monkey Wrench Gang, </i>and <i>The Journey Home. </i>In 1989, at the age of sixty-two, Edward Abbey died in Oracle, Arizona.</p><h2>A Well-Paid Slave: Curt Flood&#39;s Fight for Free Agency in Professional Sports</h2><p>Traces the landmark 1969 Supreme Court case between All-Star center fielder Curt Flood and Major League Baseball, documenting how he fought to play for the team of his choice at the cost of his career and placement in the Hall of Fame but paved the way for future players to become free agents.</p><p><b>Brad Snyder&#x2019;s</b> writing has appeared in numerous publications, including <i>The Baltimore Sun, The Washington Post</i>, and the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>. His previous book, <i>Beyond the Shadow of the Senators</i>, won the Robert Peterson Recognition Award from the Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) and was a finalist for SABR&#x2019;s Seymour Medal, <i>Spitball Magazine</i>&#x2019;s Casey Award, and <i>Elysian Fields Quarterly</i>&#x2019;s Dave Moore Award. He is a graduate of Duke University and Yale Law School.Snyder, a lawyer and baseball writer, gives an account of St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood's failed though influential suit against Major League Baseball, offering both a sturdy revision of Flood's biography and a polemical defense of the pro-player fight of which Flood was a part. Benefiting from a lawyer's pen, the intricacies of the terms "reserve clause" (which bound players "to their teams for life") and "baseball's anti-trust exemption" are quickly and clearly explained, as the world of 1960s Major League Baseball is brought to life. Before "free agency," players had few rights; after the 1969 season Flood fought being traded to Philadelphia, taking his battle to the Supreme Court. While the narrative drags at points, the stories of those central to Flood's case (like Marvin Miller, director of the Player's Association, and Arthur Goldberg, Flood's chief lawyer) are vividly rendered. Most compelling, however, is the portrait of Flood's humble upbringing (in working-class Oakland) and the racism he experienced during his early years on the field ("name-calling, segregated facilities, and second-class citizenship"). This account both serves to explain why Flood was "serious about sacrificing his playing career to sue baseball" and helps reposition Flood as a successor to Jackie Robinson's "lifelong battle against injustice." <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The author&#39;s years of hunting and guiding provides a wealth of great stories filled with adventure and more than a little humor.</p><p>Canadian hunting guide Webb (Home From the Hill) claims the "lies" of the title are "90 percent true, with the balance being a bit of exaggeration." Though certainly rough (one episode revolves around an elderly lady's use of an expletive Webb changes to "flipping"), Webb's stories (originally published in a $50 limited edition) do have the feel of truth to them, in part because he meanders his way through the book as one might wander and digress during a long conversation. This lack of focus is clear from the variety in chapter titles. "Inside Info on Picking an Outfitter" and "The Unmentionable Topic of Tips" (hint: suggesting that big game trophies will result in big tips is rude) coexist with "LeRoy and the Perverted Bear" and a story about a client who thought he could track animals by examining their excrement-leading Webb and co. to refer to him as "a true crap detective." Some chapters of the book seem to come out of the blue ("Political Correctness Has Its Rewards" turns out to be the minutes for a fictitious meeting between a naturalist and an outfitter that serves as a morality play on the economics of guiding), but overall this is a pleasant read, made cozier by Tom Hennessey's pencil drawings and an insert of photographs of the author in action, hunting and camping with family, friends and clients. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In Defense of Elitism</h2><p>The &#34;Time&#34; magazine culture critic presents the controversial argument that devotion to the myth of egalitarianism lies at the heart of the current &#34;dumbing of America&#34;</p><p>From the Pulitzer Prize-winning culture critic for <i>Time</i> magazine comes the tremendously controversial, yet highly persuasive, argument that our devotion to the largely unexamined myth of egalitarianism lies at the heart of the ongoing "dumbing of America."<p> Americans have always stubbornly clung to the myth of egalitarianism, of the supremacy of the individual average man. But here, at long last, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William A. Henry III takes on, and debunks, some basic, fundamentally ingrained ideas: that everyone is pretty much alike (and should be); that self-fulfillment is more imortant thant objective achievement; that everyone has something significant to contribute; that all cultures offer something equally worthwhile; that a truly just society would automatically produce equal success results across lines of race, class, and gender; and that the common man is almost always right. Henry makes clear, in a book full of vivid examples and unflinching opinions, that while these notions are seductively democratic they are also hopelessly wrong.</p><p> "A passionate yet reasoned argument for the proposition that some people simply contribute more to society than others.

She lives near Kansas City.<b>ONE</b><p>The first time she slit a man&#x2019;s throat she felt sick to her stomach. The second time? Not so much.<br>After she cut five or six more, the blade in her left hand began to feel like an extension of her body, and she started to take it all in stride. The exhilaration subsided, and so did the nausea. There was no longer a rush of anxiety, no longer a racing heartbeat. Blood didn&#x2019;t faze her. The thrill was gone, and that, in her line of work, was a very good thing.<br>Dr. Eleanor Kathleen Sullivan, or Ellie as she was called by her family and friends, was just four days shy of completing a grueling surgical fellowship in one of the busiest trauma centers in the Midwest. Since trauma was her specialty, she had certainly seen her share of mangled and brutalized bodies. It was her responsibility to put them back together, and as a senior fellow, she had the added duty of training the first &#x2013; and second-year residents.<br>St. Vincent&#x2019;s emergency room had been full since 4:00 A.M. that morning, and Ellie was finishing what she hoped was her last surgery of the day, a repair of a splenic rupture. A teenager, barely old enough to have a driver&#x2019;s license, had decided to test the limits of the speedometer in his parents&#x2019; Camry and had lost control, rolling the car over an embankment and landing upside down in an open field. Lucky for him, he had been wearing a seat belt, and luckier still, a man following some distance behind him had seen the whole thing and was able to call for an ambulance immediately. The boy made it to the emergency room just in time.<br>Ellie was observed by three second-year surgical residents, who hung on her every word. She was a natural teacher and, unlike 90 percent of the surgeons on staff at St. Vincent&#x2019;s Hospital, didn&#x2019;t have much of an ego. She was amazingly patient with the medical students and residents. While she worked, she explained&#x2014;and explained again&#x2014;until they finally understood what she was doing and why. No question was deemed too insignificant or foolish, which was one of the many reasons they idolized her, and for the male residents, the fact that she was drop-dead gorgeous didn&#x2019;t hurt. Because she was such a talented surgeon and supportive teacher, all these fledgling doctors fought to sign up for her rotation. Ironically, what they didn&#x2019;t know was that she was younger than most of them.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re off duty this weekend, aren&#x2019;t you, Ellie?&#x201d;<br>Ellie glanced over at Dr. Kevin Andrews, the anesthesiologist, who had asked the question. He had joined the staff six months before and, since the day he&#x2019;d met Ellie, had been hounding her to go out with him. He was an outrageous flirt and yet very sweet. Blond hair, blue eyes, tall and well built with an adorable smile, he could turn the head of almost every woman in the hospital, but for Ellie there just wasn&#x2019;t any spark.<br>&#x201c;Yes, I am. I have the whole weekend off,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Charlie, would you like to close up for me?&#x201d; she asked one of the hovering residents.<br>&#x201c;Absolutely, Dr. Sullivan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You better hurry,&#x201d; Andrews said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waking him up.&#x201d;<br>The resident looked panic-stricken.<br>&#x201c;Take your time, Charlie. He&#x2019;s just messing with you,&#x201d; she said, a smile in her voice.<br>&#x201c;Tuesday&#x2019;s your last day at St. Vincent&#x2019;s, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Andrews asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. Tuesday&#x2019;s my last official day. I might help out on a temporary basis later on, but I&#x2019;m not promising anything yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Then you could decide to come back permanently.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t reply.<br>He persisted. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll give you anything you want. You could name your price, your hours . . . you should stay here, Ellie. You belong here.&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t agree or disagree. In truth, she didn&#x2019;t know where she belonged. It had been such a hard road to get this far, she hadn&#x2019;t had time to think about the future. At least that was the excuse she used for her indecision.<br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; she finally conceded. &#x201c;I just don&#x2019;t know yet.&#x201d;<br>She stood over Charlie, watching like a mother hen. &#x201c;I want those stitches tight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, Dr. Sullivan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So Monday night is my last chance to take you to heaven?&#x201d; Andrews asked in a teasing drawl.<br>She laughed. &#x201c;Heaven? Last week you were going to rock my world. Now you&#x2019;re going to take me to heaven?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I guarantee it. I&#x2019;ve got testimonials if you want to see them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not going to happen, Kevin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not giving up.&#x201d;<br>She sighed. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;<br>As she checked the last suture, she rolled her shoulders and stretched her neck to one side then the other to get the kinks out. She&#x2019;d been in the OR since 5:00 A.M., which meant she had been bent over patients for eleven hours. Sad to say, that wasn&#x2019;t a record for her.<br>She felt wrung out and stiff and sore. A good run around the park would get those muscles moving, she decided, maybe even rev up her energy.<br>&#x201c;You know what would help you get rid of a stiff neck?&#x201d; Andrews said.<br>&#x201c;Let me guess. A trip to heaven?&#x201d;<br>One of the nurses snorted with laughter. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s awfully persistent, Dr. Sullivan. Maybe you should give in.&#x201d;<br>Ellie removed her gloves and dropped them in the trash bag by the OR doors. &#x201c;Thanks, Megan, but I think I&#x2019;ll just go for a run instead.&#x201d; As she pushed the doors wide, she untied her surgical mask and pulled off her cap, shaking her blond hair loose to fall to her shoulders.<br>Twenty minutes later she was officially off duty. She changed into her workout clothes, a pair of faded red shorts and a white tank top. She double-tied her beat-up running shoes, grabbed a rubber band and swept her hair up in a ponytail, slipped her iPod into one pocket and her cell phone into the other, and she was ready. Walking a maze of corridors to get outside, she avoided the direct route through the ER for fear she&#x2019;d get waylaid with another case.<br>There was never a lack of patients rolling through the doors. Along with the usual emergencies&#x2014;the car accidents, the heart attacks, the work injuries&#x2014;the ER saw a steady stream of victims of violent crimes. The vast majority were young men. Gangs roamed the area east of the highway, and shooting one another seemed to be a nightly sport. Since St. Vincent&#x2019;s was the largest trauma center in St. Louis, all the serious cases came to them. Weekends were a nightmare for the staff. There were times, especially during the hot summer months, when gurneys lined the halls of the ER with patients handcuffed to the railings while they waited to go into surgery. Additional police had to be routinely called in to monitor them to make certain one gang member hadn&#x2019;t been placed too close to a rival.<br>Ellie became a member of the One Hundred Club when she removed her one hundredth bullet. It wasn&#x2019;t a club she wanted to join, but she would always remember the case. The young man was only twenty years old, and it was the third time he&#x2019;d been shot. She couldn&#x2019;t forget his insolence and his cold, empty eyes. They were almost as lifeless as the cadavers down in the morgue. Patching up these boys so that they could return to the streets and the same violence was heart wrenching, and she prayed, with every surgery, that this time they would learn something, that this time they would find a new life. It was a naive hope, but she clung to it anyway.<br>Like the other overworked and underpaid residents and fellows, Ellie operated on broken bodies, the consequence of violence. But she had never actually witnessed a crime . . . until today.<br>It was a hot and humid late afternoon. Two medical students had caught up with Ellie just as she began her run on the onemile track in Cambridge Park, a vast area that sat adjacent to the hospital. Heavy rain clouds hung over them, and all three panted for air. After the first mile, both students dropped out, but Ellie was determined to get in at least one more mile before calling it quits. She made mental lists as she ran. She had a million things to do before heading home to Winston Falls.<br>Dear God, it was muggy. The humidity was so thick, she felt as though she were running through a sauna. Sweat trickled down the back of her neck, and her drenched clothes clung to her body. Her friend Jennifer, a nurse in pediatrics, who was taking a shortcut across the track to get to the ER entrance, shouted to Ellie that she was crazy to run in this heat. Ellie waved and continued on. She probably was crazy, but getting any time to work out was such a luxury, she couldn&#x2019;t afford to be choosy about the weather.<br>Ellie could hear faint cheering coming from the new soccer field across the street to the north, and as she rounded the curve, she saw the players&#x2014;high school &#x2013; age girls&#x2014;sprinting across the field. From the large number of fans in the bleachers, she guessed it was an important game.<br>The administrator of the hospital, the board, and a plethora of attorneys had fought the soccer field. They wanted to purchase the land to build another huge parking garage, and Ellie was happy they had lost their bid. Like the track and small playground to the south, the soccer field was far enough away from the hospital that, no matter how much noise the teams and fans made, the patients weren&#x2019;t disturbed.<br>Ellie was a football, basketball, and soccer fan, in that order. She loved to watch most sporting events. She admired the grace, skill, and finesse of the players, probably because she didn&#x2019;t possess any of those attributes herself. She had been such an awkward child, her mother had enrolled her in ballet classes, and she never got to play a sport. When she wasn&#x2019;t tripping over her own feet trying to do a pli�, she was reading. She was much more comfortable with her books. Her aunt Vivien liked to call her a bookworm.<br>No time to watch any games today, she thought. She had way too much to do. She returned to her mental list of things to be accomplished before she could head home to her sister&#x2019;s wedding. Oh God, how she dreaded that. She wished she had another week to get ready for the ordeal; then admitted to herself that no amount of time would prepare her for the whispers and the sympathetic smiles from her friends and family. Who could blame them? After all, her sister Ava was marrying Ellie&#x2019;s ex-fianc�. It was going to be a week of mortification, she decided. But, hey, she was tough. She could handle it.<br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; she whispered.<br>And then there was Evan Patterson. Just thinking about him made her stomach hurt. Would he dare show up in Winston Falls? God, she hoped not. But if he did, would she need to get another restraining order, even if she was going to be home for only a few days? She could feel herself getting worked up and had to force herself to calm down. She was an adult now, and she could handle anything that came her way. Even a maniac, she told herself. Besides, she was sure Evan wasn&#x2019;t back in Winston Falls. If he had returned, her father would have alerted her.<br>Ellie didn&#x2019;t want to worry about Patterson now or think about the wedding. Instead, she chose to focus on the task at hand. Just a little more than a half mile to go, then a lovely cold shower. She took her earphones from her pocket and was about to turn on her iPod to listen to a lecture on new thoracotomy procedures when she heard a loud pop.<br>Ellie stopped running. Lightning? She looked up at the ominous sky just as another pop echoed, then a third and a fourth in rapid succession. Had lightning hit a transformer? That would explain the bursts . . . except there hadn&#x2019;t been any lightning.<br>Gunshots? Had to be. As many bullets as Ellie had removed from gunshot victims, she&#x2019;d never actually heard the sound of a gun firing. The noise came from somewhere up ahead. She glanced to the right toward the soccer field. No panic there. The game was still going on, so she had to be wrong. If not gunshots . . . then what?<br>Five or six seconds had passed since the first popping sound. Ellie reached for her earphones again. Okay, she&#x2019;d been mistaken.<br>Then the screaming started.<br>Everything happened so fast. In the span of just a few more seconds, Ellie observed the chaotic scene unfold in front of her as though it were happening in slow motion.<br>In the distance, several men, wearing navy blue T-shirts and vests with FBI in bold yellow letters printed on the back, appeared almost out of nowhere and fanned out as they raced toward the trees in the center of the park. People were scattering every which way. Screams mingled with the cheers from the soccer field, the fans and players apparently oblivious to what was happening. A father ran from the playground toward the street with two little boys. The children weren&#x2019;t able to keep up, so the father scooped them into his arms and kept running. Several people who had been strolling through the park also scrambled to get away, as did three boys who had been tossing a Frisbee. One of the boys ran into the street, directly in front of an ambulance returning to the hospital. The vehicle came to a screeching halt, and the boy rushed around to the open window shouting something to the paramedic as he pointed toward the trees.<br>Suddenly, a man and a woman, linked arm in arm, drew her attention. They walked briskly toward her on the running path. There was something off about both of them. The man had a thick mustache. He wore dark glasses, a baseball cap pulled down over his forehead, and a brown, hooded windbreaker zipped up to his neck, a peculiar choice in the 90-degree weather. Was he all bundled up to keep his clothes dry when the storm broke? The man looked over his shoulder, his neck glistening with sweat. The woman looked directly at Ellie. Her bizarre appearance was startling. A short black wig sat slightly askew on her head with a few long hairs hanging down the side of her neck. Her eyes were such an intense, unnatural shade of green, she looked as though she were wearing novelty contacts, the ones you&#x2019;d buy for a Halloween party. When the couple was about thirty feet away from Ellie, they veered toward the street.<br>Someone shouted a command. Then one of the FBI agents who had run into the trees appeared and headed straight for the pair. The woman let go of the man and began to run as he slowed and pulled something from his coat pocket. When he whirled around to face the agent shouting at him, Ellie saw the gun. Before she could react, he&#x2019;d fired two shots. The first bullet struck the man in pursuit, the force so great it knocked him back before he crashed to the ground. The second bullet went wild. As Ellie dived to the grass, the shooter spun around and pointed the gun toward her. He didn&#x2019;t pull the trigger but instead ran to the street and jumped into a car that sped away.<br>The ambulance had just turned around to go in the direction the boys were pointing, but when the gunshots were fired, it changed course. Sirens on, the ambulance crossed over the curb and swerved to miss the hospital emergency entrance sign. It bounded across the park toward the gunshot victim, weaving in and out of the crowd that was scrambling toward the boulevard.<br>Ellie jumped to her feet and ran after it. Her mind was racing. Who were the surgeons on call tonight? Edmonds and Walmer, she remembered, and she&#x2019;d seen both of them in the hospital. Good.<br>The target had been a good distance away from the shooter, but he&#x2019;d taken a direct hit to the torso. Ellie had no idea how bad the wound was, but she thought, if she could stabilize him, he&#x2019;d make it to the OR.<br>The ambulance crossed the grassy area of the park in...</p></p><h2>Eclipse (The Twilight Saga)</h2><p>Bella must choose between her friendship with Jacob, a werewolf, and her relationship with Edward, a vampire, but when Seattle is ravaged by a mysterious string of killings, the three of them need to decide whether their personal lives are more important than the well-being of an entire city.</p><p>Stephenie Meyer is the author of the #1 bestselling Twilight Saga and <i>The Host</i>.

They have a 3,000-word vocabulary transmitted in the form of scents and phytochemicals exchanged through the air and via the wood wide web of mycelium networks underground.

A journey which begins at the foot of the Benjamin Franklin statue in San Francisco's Washington Square, which wanders through the wonders of America's rural waterways, and which ends, inevitably, with mayonnaise. Funny, wild, and sweet,<i> Trout Fishing in America</i> is an incomparable guidebook to the delights of exploration -- both of land and mind. <br><br> Richard Brautigan was a literary idol of the 1960s and 1970s whose comic genius and iconoclastic vision of American life caught the imagination of young people everywhere. His early books became required reading for the hip generation, and on its publication, <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>, considered by many as his best novel, became an international bestseller.With it Brautigan caught the public's attention and became a cult hero. By 1970 <i>Trout Fishing in America </i>had become the namesake of a commune, a free school, an underground newspaper, and more. <br><br></p><p><b>Richard Brautigan</b> (1935-1984) was a literary idol of the 1960s and 1970s whose comic genius and iconoclastic vision of American life caught the imagination of young people everywhere. He was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, and moved to San Francisco in the mid-1950s when he became involved in the emerging beat scene. During the 1960s, he became one of the most prominent and prolific writers of the counterculture. Out of this period came some of his most famous works, the best known of which are <i>Trout Fishing in America</i>; his collection of poetry, <i>The Pill versus the Springhill Mine Disaster</i>; and his collection of stories, <i>Revenge of the Lawn</i>. Translated the world over, his works helped establish him as one of the most significant American writers of his generation. As his popularity waned towards the end of the 1970s, he became increasingly disillusioned about his work and his life. He committed suicide in 1984.

She lives in Somerville, MA.Here are some points to consider when beginning an album and choosing the best structure for your project:<br>- How many items (such as photos, drawings, or three-dimensional objects) will the album hold? Will the items be on both sides of the leaves or just one? Make sure the structure you choose will accommodate them.&nbsp;- How heavy are your items? If they are heavy enough, you may need a heavier-weight text paper to support them. This could range from watercolor paper to mat board to a heavy-weight drawing paper. The pages should support your objects. However, heavier-weight text papers mean stiffer pages. Stiffer pages in the book won&#x2019;t turn as well, and could lead to their own structural issues, such as cracking. Make sure you find the right balance of support and usability.<br><br>- Will your items be displayed both horizontally and vertically? If so, you will need a larger page to accommodate this. If you&#x2019;re planning to use a landscape format, consider the weight of the paper and how it will be supported on the fore edge. An item that is too heavy for the supporting paper will cause the supporting paper to rip, sag, and not display or shelve correctly. Choose a support that is sturdier&#x2014;as thick or heavy, or thicker or heavier&#x2014;than the item.&nbsp;- How will your items be attached to the page? You could use solutions such as slots at the item corners, photo-mounting corners, or mounting strips&#x2014;or you could make an album with frames.&nbsp;- What color pages will bring out the best in the items on them? Black is great. It has a traditional look and makes colors pop, but it scratches easily. White is classic, but it can look dirty easily.&nbsp;- Does the album need a title label on the cover? Paper labels are easy to make with word processing applications. Experiment with text boxes and borders.&nbsp;- How about embellishments? Where could you easily integrate a ribbon, beads, or other collage material? You need to consider the collective height of any inclusions when planning your album and how it will function. Adding enough room for the inclusions at the spine when making the book will help the album function well into the future.<br></p><h2>Windhorse Woman: A Marriage of Spirit</h2><p>From the New York Times bestselling author of Star Woman and Ceystal, here is the visionary autobiography that began in Medicine Woman. Andrews offers essential lessons about love and unity that will readers forge their own visions and lives.</p><p>The author, who claims to be apprentice to a Canadian medicine woman named Agnes Whistling Elk, has produced five books ( Medicine Woman , etc.) about her quest for spiritual knowledge. Written in the same dreamy, repetitive style, and set in Nepal where Andrews's Amerindian entourage encounters ancient Indian wisdom, this latest entry reads more like a fairy tale than the ethnological fact it purports to be. She meets her tall, well-built, spirit husband Windhorse, who points her toward her androgynous balance of female and male energies within herself. Her hostess-guide Ani turns out to be a guran , one who can manifest herself as a snow leopard at will. A 10-year-old girl's death forces Andrews to face her own mortality. Her Himalayan jaunt is dotted with episodes of crystal power, tears of joy, wise women, rapt visions and talk of healing Mother Earth. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Uncommon</h2><p><p><b><i>Uncommon</i> is a battle cry for women to step out of the ordinary and live differently. </b><br><i>It's a blueprint for a life full of passion and purpose.

Ordained at twelve, he would eventually become the first Buddhist chaplain at an American university, the founder of a retreat center and monastery, and a bestselling author. Here, Bhante G. lays bare the often-surprising ups and downs of his seventy-five years, from his boyhood in Sri Lanka to his decades of sharing the insights of the Buddha, telling his story with the &#34;plain-English&#34; approach for which he is so renowned.</p><p>Bhante Gunaratana was ordained at the age of twelve as a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka, earned his PhD in philosophy from The American University, and has led meditation retreats, taught Buddhism, and lectured widely throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Bhante Henepola Gunaratana is the president of the Bhavana Society in High View, West Virginia, where he lives.<br> <br>Jeanne Malmgren, a longtime Buddhist, has been a magazine and newspaper journalist since 1980. Her writing has won awards from the Florida Society of Newspaper Editors, the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors, and the Society of Professional Journalists. She lives in Greenville, South Carolina."Spiritual teachers who write autobiographies are not always candid about their more human characteristics, but Bhante G's book is humorous and open. There is no doubt that this is the story of someone who chose to go his own way and live his vision. Like all good teachers, his story can inspire us to live our own." Source: The Middle Way<br><br>"Monks and nuns in the Buddhist tradition are often viewed as people who don't necessarily struggle as intensely with difficult emotions as the rest of us. Bhante G., as he is affectionately called, dispels that perception and reveals the intimate truths of his life with unflinching honesty, humor, and warmth. The author of the highly acclaimed bestseller Mindfulness in Plain English, Bhante G never loses sight of the Buddha's teachings throughout a life marked by hardship and despair as well as great achivement and happiness. Time and again, we see that Bhante is undaunted by adversity. His tireless energy and unwavering faith reminds us that we too can embody these very same qualities. ...The scope of this book is wide and rich in detail; Bhante's message is inspiring." Source: Insight<br><br>"Bhante Gunaratana's stature across America as a Buddhist teacher has risen with the popularity of his classic <i>Mindfulness in Plain Eng</i>lish. While Bhante's narrative doesn't leave out the hard parts, this is still, of course, a success story. And here lies the promise and purpose of <i>Journey to Mindfulness</i>: if Bhante G. can do it, so can you." Source: Shambhala Sun<br><br>"A most refreshing book from a Buddhist meditation teacher who lays bare his human failings and admits they are as much a part of his life as his achievements. It is also a fascinating globe- and culture-crossing autobiography of a man born in a small village in Sri Lanka with enough persistence and good kamma (Pali for karma) to see him through many vicissitudes. Author of the bestseller Mindfulness in Plain English, Bhante G., as he is affectionately known, repeatedly ran away from monasteries where he lived as a boy monk, stole things as a child, smoked and had traumatic fear-inducing accidents with water. As his story makes clear, his is a very human journey of teaching himself as well as others what the Buddha taught about how to live. That organizations that promote ethical living and spiritual development should also have their share of bickering, envy, and bad behavior is an unsurprising part of his story, candidly told without excess rancor or blame. The monk-author is fluent in different cultures as well as languages, and his autobiography contributes to an understanding of the relationship between the American Buddhism of converts and traditional Asian Buddhism, more specifically the Theravada branch of Buddhism as practiced in his native Sri Lanka. This plain-English look back at 75 years of an admixture of adversity, humility, and hard-won wisdom tells an engaging story that non-Buddhists can appreciate as well as Buddhists." Source: Publishers Weekly<br><br>"<i>Journey to Mindfulness</i> flows like a good Buddhist teaching, rich with anecdotes and detail from Bhante G.'s life. The story has just the right amount of history woven into Bhante's travels and adventures. It is also a very funny book. It seems that even monks can have a great sense of humor." Source: St. Petersburg Times<br><br>"Bhante Gunaratana is a meditation master who lives in each present moment. In <i>Journey to Mindfulness</i>, Bhante demonstrates, with warmth, humor, and rare candor, how it is possible to overcome experiences of abuse, rejection, and our own emotional reactivity through the practice of mindfulness.<i> Journey to Mindfulness</i> is an exhilarating journey into the mind and heart of someone whose life has been dedicated to living and sharing the Buddha's teaching." Author: Matt Flickstein, author of Swallowing the River Ganges<br><br>"Wow! As a young, beginner Buddhist, I find Bhante G's seventy-five year life as a monk tremendously inspiring. Without sentimentality or excuses, Bhante G candidly and painfully reveals his shadow side--the rebelliousness, anger and uncontrollable emotion as a teenager and young man--and how he overcame his difficulties. All young adults exploring a path in the dharma should read this book! It both breaks down illusions and over-idealism about Buddhism and gives a vision, in a realistic way, of how to attain the highest in our lifetimes. An old, humble monk reflecting on his arrogant youth has invaluable lessons for us young adults just setting forth on the long path." Author: Sumi Loundon, editor of Blue Jean Buddha: Voices of Young Buddhists<br><br>"Like the stories of the wisest and kindest of grandfathers. A joy to read." Author: Sylvia Boorstein, author of Pay Attention for Goodness' Sake: Practicing the Perfections of the Heart, The Buddhist Path of Kindness<br><br>"Fascinating, and comforting in its honesty." Author: Kate Wheeler, author of Not Where I Started From<br><br>"The 75-five-year-old teacher of Buddhist meditation, Bhante Gunaratana, reveals his human failings and shows how they are as much a part of his life as his accomplishments. The author of the bestselling <i>Mindfulness in Plain English</i>, he writes with refreshing candor. This plain-spoken book is a mix of humor, wisdom, adversity, and what appears to be genuine humility. As a child, Bhante exhibited bad behaviors, but shows how he taught himself and others what the Buddha taught, and how to live. He is now one of Buddhism's great teachers. An easy and engaging read that you don't have to be Buddhist to appreciate."

Taken together, they are the culmination of more than fifty years of reflection on liberalism and on some of the most pressing problems of our times by John Rawls. </p><p> "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" explains why the constraints of public reason, a concept first discussed in <i>Political Liberalism</i> (1993), are ones that holders of both religious and non-religious comprehensive views can reasonably endorse. It is Rawls's most detailed account of how a modern constitutional democracy, based on a liberal political conception, could and would be viewed as legitimate by reasonable citizens who on religious, philosophical, or moral grounds do not themselves accept a liberal comprehensive doctrine--such as that of Kant, or Mill, or Rawls's own "Justice as Fairness," presented in <i>A Theory of Justice</i> (1971). </p><p> <i>The Law of Peoples</i> extends the idea of a social contract to the Society of Peoples and lays out the general principles that can and should be accepted by both liberal and non-liberal societies as the standard for regulating their behavior toward one another. In particular, it draws a crucial distinction between basic human rights and the rights of each citizen of a liberal constitutional democracy. It explores the terms under which such a society may appropriately wage war against an "outlaw society," and discusses the moral grounds for rendering assistance to non-liberal societies burdened by unfavorable political and economic conditions. </p></p><p><b>John Rawls</b> was James Bryant Conant University Professor at Harvard University. He was recipient of the 1999 National Humanities Medal.[These essays are] some of [Rawls's] strongest published expressions of feeling...These are the final products of a remarkably pure and concentrated career...The writings of John Rawls, whom it is now safe to describe as the most important political philosopher of the twentieth century...owe their influence to the fact that their depth and their insight repay the close attention that their uncompromising theoretical weight and erudition demand. (Thomas Nagel <i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>Rawls offers us the appealing vision of a social order that every citizen finds legitimate despite large differences in their personal values. In <i>The Law of Peoples</i>, he attempts a parallel feat for global society. He tries to spell out a Law of Peoples that both liberal and non-liberal peoples can agree upon to govern their international relations. This involves steering a judicious mid-course between liberalism's imperialist and isolationist tendencies...I should say straight away that this is the most engaging and accessible book Rawls has written. Although some of the daunting conceptual apparatus from <i>Political Liberalism</i> appears from time to time, for the most part Rawls lays out his argument in a straightforward way, and refers extensively to historical and contemporary episodes to illustrate it. (David Miller <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>John Rawls is one of the great political philosophers of the 20th century...His ideas have not only sparked a lively debate among philosophers, which continues to this day, but they have also been taken up by economists, sociologists and others. So <i>The Law of Peoples</i>, Mr. Rawls's latest work and probably his last significant effort, deserves to be read with interest, and some respect. (<i>The Economist</i>)<br><br>Now, in an effort to turn realpolitik on its big, bald head, Rawls in <i>The Law of Peoples</i> proposes to extend his historicist, pragmatic notions of justice to the larger world of 'peoples'--the term he prefers to 'nations.' He lays out a series of general principles--among them, that peoples are free and independent, should honor human rights, and should observe a duty of nonintervention--that can and should be accepted as a standard for regulating their behavior toward one another. Without the slightest hint of millenarian fever, he goes so far as to assert that we stand on the brink of a 'realistic utopia'...<i>The Law of Peoples</i> seems likely to reframe the debate about what is possible in the international realm. In contrast to the chastened, inward gaze of most 20th-century thought, Rawls's book is one of those rare works of philosophy that directs its energies outward. It has the potential to send shockingly optimistic reverberations through the world at large, and maybe even jolt those somber-suited realists right out of the realpolitik. (Will Blythe <i>Civilization</i>)<br><br>Why should we care whether Rawls has modified his difference principle so that it avoids unpopular outcomes? In the course of doing so, he advances some excellent arguments.

The dumps, mopes, Mondays; the ocean, the sky, and the deep, deep ice. The Whale. Jay. Ribbon. Fin. The grass in Kentucky. The china in Grandmother&#x2019;s pantry. Of all the colors, blue has the widest range of associations, and the widest bandwidth of emotional tints and shades. It is therefore the most suitable color of interior life. Whether slick light sharp high bright and thin or low deep sweet thick dark and soft, blue moves easily among them all, and all profoundly qualify our states of feeling. This eccentric essay into the "world of blue" is the heart of the heart of Gass&#x2019;s oeuvre.</p><p>In this, one of the strangest books about writing and language you&#39;re likely ever to read, fiction writer and philosophy professor Gass spins off into an improvisational inquiry into the nature of words and consciousness, using as his departure point the concept of the color blue--the idea of blue, the state of blue, the uses of blue...the bluenesses of blue. It&#39;s kind of hard to sum up, and if it sounds weird, it is--but it&#39;s also wonderful.Of the colors, blue and green have the greatest emotional range. Sad reds and melancholy yellows are difficult to turn up. Among the ancient elements, blue occurs everywhere: in ice and water, in the flame as purely as the flower, overhead and inside caves, covering fruit and oozing out of clay. Although green enlivens the earth and mixes in the ocean, and we find it, copperish, in fire, green air, green skies, are rare. Gray and brown are widely distributed, but there are no joyful swatches of either, or of any exuberant black, sullen pink, or acquiescent orange. Blue is therefore most suitable as the color of interior life. Whether slick light sharp high bright thin quick sour new and cool or low deep sweet thick dark soft slow smooth heavy old and warm: blue moves easily among them all, and all profoundly qualify our states of feeling. <p>Not since Herman Melville pondered the whiteness of Moby Dick has a region of the spectrum been subjected to such eclectic scrutiny . . .

The patient reconstructs the events in his life into a palatable reality founded upon compromise and rationalization.</p><p>The pliant protagonist of Italo Svevo's 1923 classic <i>Confessions of Zeno</i> is, among other things, a bumbling businessman, a guilt-ridden adulterer, and a hardcore nicotine addict. What Zeno Cosini most definitely is <i>not</i> is wordless. For the novel is in fact a dense and comically excruciating exercise in self-revelation, undertaken by the narrator as part of his psychoanalytic treatment. Zeno never finds a cure for his affliction, which seems to be a strain of continental angst. Yet his reflections remain as audacious as they are exhaustive--and, much of the time, masterfully absorbing.<p> As we soon discover, Zeno is a master is the convoluted rationalization. He concocts numerous reasons why his "last cigarette" needn't truly become his last; he strives endlessly to convince himself that he loves his wife; he tirelessly justifies an awkward affair, all the while vacillating between a paralysis of action and a lazy submission. "My resolutions are less drastic and, as I grow older, I become more indulgent to my weaknesses," Zeno proclaims early on. (Later he backpedals even further, confessing that his "resolutions existed for their own sake and had no practical results whatever.") As a last-ditch tactic, he transmutes his disappointments into inevitabilities--an act of creative bookkeeping that becomes steadily creepier as the narrative unfolds.</p><p> There are times, to be sure, when Zeno seems to grasp that life isn't merely feints and games, that subterfuge and dark motivation aren't the whole of human transaction. Yet he always retreats back into his extravagant, consoling fantasies. Perhaps that's why Svevo's book still has the power to discomfit: Zeno's ingenious whitewashing of an indifferent world feels alarmingly like the fictions we tell ourselves on a daily basis. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>therapy, Zeno&#39;s doctor advises him to write his memoirs.

Frederica, the independent young heroine, is involved in both. She startled her intellectual circle of friends by marrying a young country squire, whose violent streak has now been turned against her. Fleeing to London with their young son, she gets a teaching job in an art school, where she is thrown into the thick of the new decade. Poets and painters are denying the value of the past, fostering dreams of rebellion, which focus around a strange, charismatic figure -- the near-naked, unkempt and smelly Jude Mason, with his flowing gray hair, a hippie before his time.<br><br>We feel the growing unease, the undertones of sex and cruelty. The tension erupts over his novel <b>Babbletower</b>, set in a past revolutionary era, where a band of people retire to a castle to found an ideal community. In this book, as in the courtrooms, as in the art school's haphazard classes and on the committee set up to study "the teaching of language," people function increasingly in groups. Many are obsessed with protecting the young, but the fashionable notion of children as innocent and free slowly comes to seem wishful, and perilous.<br><br><b>Babel Tower</b> is the third, following <b>The Virgin in the Garden</b> and <b>Still Life</b>, of a planned quartet of novels set in different mid-century time frames. The personal and legal crises of Frederica mirror those of the age. This is the decade of the Beatles, the Death of God, the birth of computer languages. In Byatt's vision, the presiding genius of the 1960s seems to be a blend of the Marquis de Sade and <b>The Hobbit</b>.

You just need to restrict what you eat for 2 days a week. You will see the pounds drop off, your blood sugar levels stabilize, and your waist shrink.<br><br><b>Diet just 2 days a week to drop the pounds and dodge type 2 diabetes!</b><br> <br> In a recent study, researchers in the UK found that restricting carbohydrates just two days per week was superior to a standard, daily calorie-restricted diet for both reducing weight (about 9 pounds lost vs 5 pounds) and lowering insulin levels (reduced by 22% vs 4 %). Based on this and other research indicating that safe weight loss is the key to reversing and preventing diabetes, <i>Reader's Digest</i> has partnered with registered dietitian and diabetes expert Erin Palinski to distill the latest science to create an easy-to-follow plan that allows people with diabetes to have their cake&#x2014;and other carbs&#x2014;and still keep their blood sugar under control.<br> <br> A diagnosis of diabetes can be overwhelming and frightening, and even many of those who have lived with diabetes for years often struggle with the question of what they can eat. <i>The 2-Day Diabetes Diet</i> makes it simple&#x2014;there are no forbidden foods and no carb-counting. You just need to restrict what you eat for 2 days a week&#x2014;and research suggests you will see the pounds drop off, your blood sugar levels stabilize, and your waist shrink.<br> <br> On those 2 days a week, you follow the low-carb &#x201c;Power Burn&#x201d; program, and consume approximately 600 calories of selected foods. What does that look like on your plate? How about a 2-egg omelet with onions and peppers plus yogurt for breakfast; a hearty bowl of carrot soup plus fresh fruit for lunch; meatloaf and broccoli for dinner with milk; and a cup of sweet grapes for a snack? Or Canadian bacon and spinach for breakfast with a cup of milk; vegetable soup and half a banana topped with peanut butter for lunch; grilled chicken and zucchini over pasta for dinner; and an orange with a cup of milk for a snack. With real delicious food filling your tummy, you won&#x2019;t believe it all adds up to only about 600 calories.<br> <br> For the rest of the week, you follow a delicious 1500-calorie-a-day Mediterranean-style eating plan&#x2014;we call these &#x201c;Nourishment&#x201d; days.

Brittany during the nineteenth century was a place seemingly frozen in the Middle Ages, backwards by most French standards; formal education among rural society was either unavailable or dismissed as unnecessary, while the church and local myth defined most people's reasoning and motivation. Jean-Marie D�guignet is unique not only as a literate Breton peasant, but in his skepticism for the church, his interest in science, astronomy and languages, and for his keen&#x2014;often caustic&#x2014;observations of the world and people around him.<br><br>Born into rural poverty in 1834, D�guignet escapes Brittany by joining the French Army in 1854, and over the next fourteen years he fights in the Crimean war, attends Napoleon III&#x2019;s coronation ceremonies, supports Italy&#x2019;s liberation struggle, and defends the hapless French puppet emperor Maximilian in Mexico. He teaches himself Latin, French, Italian and Spanish and reads extensively on history, philosophy, politics, and literature. He returns home to live as a farmer and tobacco-seller, eventually falling back into dire poverty. Throughout the tale, Deguignet&#x2019;s freethinking, almost anarchic views put him ahead of his time and often (sadly, for him) out of step with his contemporaries.<br><br>D�guignet&#x2019;s voluminous journals (nearly 4,000 pages in total) were discovered in a farmhouse in Brittany a century after they were written. This narrative was drawn from them and became a surprise bestseller when published in France in 1998.</p><p><p>Born in 1834 to landless farmers in Brittany, the young <b>JEAN-MARIE D�GUIGNET</b> was sent out several times a week as a child to beg for his family&#x2019;s food. After spending his adolescence as a cowherd and a domestic, he abandoned the province for a soldier&#x2019;s life, avid for knowledge of the wider world. Having grown up speaking only Breton, D�guinet taught himself Latin, French, Italian and Spanish and read broadly in history, philosophy, politics and literature during his travels. He was sent to fight in the Crimean war, to attend Emperor Napoleon III&#x2019;s coronation ceremonies, to support Italy&#x2019;s liberation struggle, and to defend the hapless French puppet emperor Maximilian in Mexico. Eventually D�guinet returned home to Brittany, where he worked as a farmer and tobacconist before falling back into poverty. He died in 1905.&nbsp;</p>"What makes it gripping reading is not only that it offers a rare view of 19th-century French society from the bottom up; it is also written from the perspective of a lifetime&#x2019;s experience. He both suffers and celebrates his suffering as the price of his nonconformity. A fascinating account."&#x2014;<b>Alan Riding</b>, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Linda Asher has now given D�guignet a splendidly faithful English voice: pugnacious, tetchy and opinionated."&#x2014;<b>David Coward</b>, L<i>ondon Review of Books</i><br><br>"Never a dull moment in his company.

He died two years later and his fiery widow, Eleanor, wanted nothing more than to keep his memory alive. With her forceful will, she and the irascible producer Samuel Goldwyn quickly agreed to make a film based on Gehrig's life, <i>The Pride of the Yankees</i>. Goldwyn didn't understand--or care about--baseball. For him this film was the emotional story of a quiet, modest hero who married a spirited woman who was the love of his life, and, after a storied career, gave a short speech that transformed his legacy. With the world at war and soldiers dying on foreign soil, it was the kind of movie America needed. <br><br>Using original scrips, letters, memos, and other rare documents, Richard Sandomir tells the behind-the-scenes story of how a classic was born. There was the so-called Scarlett O'Hara-like search to find the actor to play Gehrig; the stunning revelations Elanor made to the scriptwriter Paul Gallico about her life with Lou; the intensive training Cooper underwent to learn how to catch, throw, and hit a baseball for the first time; and the story of two now-legendary Hollywood actors in Gary Cooper and Teresa Wright whose nuanced performances endowed the Gehrigs with upstanding dignity and cemented the baseball icon's legend. <br><br>Sandomir writes with great insight and aplomb, painting a fascinating portrait of a bygone Hollywood era, a mourning widow with a dream, and the shadow a legend cast on one of the greatest sports films of all time. <br></p><p>Richard Sandomir has been the award-winning sports media and sports business writer for the <i>New York Times</i> since 1991.He is the author or co-author of several books including <i>Bald Like Me</i>, and, most recently, <i>The Enlightened Bracketologist</i>, and its sequel, <i>The Final Four of Everything.</i>"Intriguing...a must for movie and baseball buffs...Sandomir mines a rich vein of lustrous personalities."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The New York Times</i><br></i></b><br><br>"The riveting story behind the making of <i>The Pride of the Yankees</i> is finally being told in Richard Sandomir's meticulously researched and gracefully written book. He brings to vivid life Eleanor Gehrig, Gary Cooper, and Samuel Goldwyn's efforts to turn a hero's life into a heartfelt film."&#x2015;<b><i>Gay Talese<br></i></b><br><br>"It wouldn't be much of a stretch to call Sandomir's book as much of a classic as the movie that inspired it."&#x2015;<b><i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune<br></i></b><br><br>"If you grew up with <i>The Pride of the Yankees </i>as a yearly staple on Ch. 11--or just watch it now whenever it pops up on MLB Network--you must read Richard Sandomir's book of the same name on the making of that wonderful movie....You'll be done - and ready to watch the movie all over again"&#x2015;<b><i>Mike Vaccaro, <i>New York Post</i></i></b><br><br>"The brave, tragic story of Lou Gehrig, the great baseball player, was a script waiting to be written. With affection and reportorial savvy, Richard Sandomir describes how one myth begat another to produce the legendary baseball movie that still can make people cry. <i>The Pride of the Yankees</i> recalls a lost world, when Hollywood had the power to create dreams that people wanted to believe."&#x2015;<b><i>Julie Salamon, author of <i>The Devil's Candy </i>and <i>Wendy and the Lost Boys</i></i></b><br><br>"More than the story of a movie or even an era of baseball, Richard Sandomir's brilliantly reported book transports us back to an age of real heroes who had both grit and elegance. In doing so, he issues a valuable challenge to today's stars: character matters."&#x2015;<b><i>James Andrew Miller, bestselling author of <i>Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN</i><br></i></b><br><br>"How was Lou Gehrig's timeless story brought to the Big Screen? Richard Sandomir answers that question with deft precision and warmth."&#x2015;<b><i>Tim McCarver, former MLB catcher and announcer for the St. Louis Cardinals<br></i></b><br><br>"Sandomir spotlights a significant moment in baseball history and solidifies Gehrig for a new generation of Yankees fans."&#x2015;<b><i>ESPN.com</i></b><br><br>"The fascinating inside story of the 75-year-old film....Even if you've seen the movie 100 times, this book will give you a different perspective."&#x2015;<b><i><i>The Chicago Tribune</i><br></i></b><br><br>"There are very few great movies about sports, but after more than seventy years <i>The Pride of the Yankees</i> remains at the top of the roster because it focuses on the pride and grace that sports, at their best, display. As Richard Sandomir's fascinating book shows, this beautiful movie emerged simply because Samuel Goldwyn needed a vehicle for Gary Cooper, whose gift for quiet anguish made Lou Gehrig immortal.

Rushed northward on a royal train&#x2014;and nearly murdered themselves en route&#x2014;the pair are soon joined by Mycroft, and learn of the brutal killings of two of the Queen's servants, a renowned architect and his foreman, both of whom had been working on the renovation of the famous and forbidding Royal Palace of Holyrood, in Edinburgh. Mycroft has enlisted his brother to help solve the murders that may be key elements of a much more elaborate and pernicious plot on the Queen's life. But the circumstances of the two victims' deaths also call to Holmes' mind the terrible murder&#x2014;in Holyrood&#x2014;of "The Italian Secretary," David Rizzio. Only Rizzio, a music teacher and confidante of Mary, Queen of Scots, was murdered three centuries ago. Holmes proceeds to alarm Watson with the announcement that the Italian Secretary's vengeful spirit may have taken the lives of the two men as punishment for disturbing the scene of his assassination. Critically acclaimed, bestselling author Caleb Carr's brilliant new offering takes the Conan Doyle tradition to remarkable new heights with this spellbinding tale.</p><p>Although Sherlock Holmes categorically dismissed, in "The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire," supernatural explanations for corporeal crimes ("This Agency stands flat-footed upon the ground, and there it must remain. ... No ghosts need apply"), one of the most popular among Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x2019;s Holmes tales is <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> (1902), in which the fate of a Devonshire family supposedly hangs on the savage appetites of an apparitional beast. More than a century later, in <i>The Italian Secretary</i>, Caleb Carr again presents the hawk-faced consulting detective with a yarn woven of paranormal plot threads, the mystery this time rooted in the fatal 16th-century stabbing of David Rizzio, a music teacher and confidant to Mary, Queen of Scots.<p> For Holmes and his affable annalist, Dr. John Watson, this spirited escapade begins sometime in the late 19th century with their receipt, in London, of an encrypted telegram from Sherlock's eccentric elder brother, Mycroft, "a senior but anonymous government official." It summons them to Edinburgh, Scotland, where architect Sir Alistair Sinclair and his foreman, Dennis McKay, have been slain in the midst of rehabilitating the medieval west tower of the Royal Palace of Holyrood--the very wing where Queen Mary had lived, and where Rizzio had met his brutal, politically motivated end. Mycroft fears these murders portend new threats against Britain's present monarch--the elderly Queen Victoria, who infrequently lodges at the palace--by a known assassin, perhaps in nefarious league with the German Kaiser. En route north, Holmes and Watson are menaced aboard their train by a red-bearded bomb thrower (supposedly a rabid Scots nationalist), only to discover that still greater dangers await them, and others, at Holyroodhouse. The plaintive drone of a weeping woman, cruelly punctured and shattered corpses, a pool of blood "that never dries," and a disembodied Italian voice with unexpected musical tastes all imply the wrath of wraiths behind recent atrocities. But Holmes and Watson deduce that greed, rather than ghosts, may be to blame.</p><p> Carr, who earned renown with his historical mysteries, <i>The Alienist</i> (1994) and <i>The Angel of Darkness</i> (1997), apparently intended <i>The Italian Secretary</i> to be a short story; however, he couldn't stop writing. The result is a fleet-footed, atmospherically gothic, and often amusing Holmes tale (with an exposition scene in Watson's bed chamber that&#x2019;s truly priceless), but one that makes scant attempt to enhance our understanding of Conan Doyle's characters--a less ambitious undertaking, in that respect, than Mitch Cullin's concurrently published <i>A Slight Trick of the Mind</i>. And while Carr displays a gift here for adopting another author's literary techniques, it is really his own style and series players that his fans are waiting to see more of in the future. --<i>J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><i>Caleb Carr's novel, </i>The Alienist<i>, </i><i>was a blockbuster international bestseller and positioned its author as a modern master of the historical thriller. Now, Carr reaches back further, to the age of opium dens and Jack the Ripper, when fictional detective Sherlock Holmes made the science of murder as real as the gore on a killer's hands...</i><br><br>FOUL WHISPERINGS...<br>Mycroft Holmes's encoded message to his brother, Sherlock, is unsubtle enough even for Dr. Watson to decipher: a matter concerning the safety of Queen Victoria herself calls them to Edinburgh's Holyrood House to investigate the confounding and gruesome deaths of two young men--horrific incidents that took place with her highness in residence. The victims were crushed in a manner surpassing human power. And while recent attempts on her majesty's life raise a number of possibilities, these intrigues also seem strangely connected to an act of evil that took place centuries earlier...<br><br>...UNNATURAL DEEDS<br>For indeed, the slaying of David Rizzio, music master and friend to Mary Queen of Scots, was an extraordinarily brutal and treacherous act--even for a time when brutality and treachery were the order of the day.

The book then proceeds to confute this pronouncement at every turn, exposing a world less sad than pathetic, and more shot through with hypocrisy and deceit than its incredulous narrator, John Dowell, cares to imagine. Somewhat forgotten as a classic, <i>The Good Soldier</i> has been called everything from the consummate novelist's novel to one of the greatest English works of the century. And although its narrative hook--the philandering of an otherwise noble man--no longer shocks, its unerring cadences and doleful inevitabilities proclaim an enduring appeal.<p> Ford's novel revolves around two couples: Edward Ashburnham--the title's soldier--and his capable if off-putting wife, Leonora; and long-transplanted Americans John and Florence Dowell. The foursome's ostensible amiability, on display as they pass parts of a dozen pre-World War I summers together in Germany, conceals the fissures in each marriage. John is miserably mismatched with the garrulous, cuckolding Florence; and Edward, dashing and sentimental, can't refrain from falling in love with women whose charms exceed Leonora's. Predictably, Edward and Florence conduct their affair, an indiscretion only John seems not to notice. After the deaths of the two lovers, and after Leonora explains much of the truth to John, he recounts the events of their four lives with an extended inflection of outrage. From his retrospective perch, his recollections simmer with a bitter skepticism even as he expresses amazement at how much he overlooked.</p><p> Dowell's resigned narration is flawlessly conversational--haphazard, sprawling, lusting for sympathy. He exudes self-preservation even as he alternately condemns and lionizes Edward: "If I had had the courage and the virility and possibly also the physique of Edward Ashburnham I should, I fancy, have done much what he did." Stunningly, Edward's adultery comes to seem not merely excusable, but almost sublime. "Perhaps he could not bear to see a woman and not give her the comfort of his physical attractions," John surmises. Ford's novel deserves its reputation if for no other reason than the elegance with which it divulges hidden lives. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Ford Madox Ford wrote The Good Soldier, the book on which his reputation most surely rests, in deliberate emulation of the nineteenth-century French novels he so admired. In this way he was able to explore the theme of sexual betrayal and its poisonous after-effects with a psychological intimacy as yet unknown in the English novel.</p><h2>The Eccentric Teapot: Four Hundred Years of Invention</h2><p>The Eccentric Teapot Short and stout, of course, is the very least of it. Inspired by the advent of tea drinking four thousand years ago in China, the form of the teapot has arrived in endlessly imaginative variations - humble, elegant, quirky, abstract. In the last two decades the investigation of the teapot as a pure art form has reached an inventive peak, but a fascination with the ceremony of tea drinking and with the objects designed for that ceremony has long flourished in both Eastern and Wester cultures. This beautiful and delightful book introduces us to come of the most sublime, outrageous, and exotic teapots ever to grace a Mad Hatter&#39;s tea party. The designed of these idiosyncratic vessels have fully explored the ceremonial significance, spiritual associations, and formal complexities of teapots and tea drinking, but they have given the results a distinctly eccentric spin. Both comfortingly familiar and utterly peculiar, this fanciful, provocative, and intriguing gallery of teapots includes portrait teapots of Oscar Wilde, Brooke Shields, and Queen Elizabeth; teapots impersonating animals, vegetables, and Three Mile Island cooling towers: the teapots so far removed from the concerns of function that they resemble nothing so much as drawings of teapots. The form of this simple object has fueled the creative genius of art, craft, and industry toward ends as diverse as pure aesthetics, perfect utility, lighthearted whimsy, and political satire. ...</p><p></p><h2>Consider the Years 1938-1946</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Perfectly Clean.

Have you ever thought that the whole universe might be a crazy, mixed-up dream? If you have, then you've had hints of the Change War.It's been going on for a billion years and it will last another billion or so. Up and down the timeline, the two sides--"Spiders" and "Snakes"--battle endlessly to change the future and the past. Our lives, our memories, are their battleground. And in the midst of the war is the Place, outside space and time, where Greta Forzane and the other Entertainers provide solace and r-&amp;-r for tired time warriors.</p><p>Fritz Leiber (1910-1992) is best known as a fantasy writer, but his achievements and influence are also considerable in the horror and science fiction fields. One of his major SF works is the Change War series, about rival time-traveling armies locked in a bitter, age-old war for control of existence; the battles frequently alter the course of human history. The most important work of Leiber's Change War series is the Hugo Award-winning novel <i>The Big Time</i>, in which doctors, entertainers, and wounded soldiers find themselves treacherously trapped with an activated atomic bomb inside the Place, a room existing outside of space-time. It's not one of Leiber's strongest novels: the cutesy-girlish narrative voice is unconvincing, while the demands of describing time travel and time paradoxes inevitably strain the prose. But <i>The Big Time</i> is a tense, claustrophobic SF mystery, and possibly the ultimate locked-room whodunit.<p> In addition to the Hugo, Nebula, Derleth, Lovecraft, and World Fantasy Awards, Fritz Leiber received the Grand Master of Fantasy (Gandalf) Award, the Life Achievement Lovecraft Award, and the Grand Master Nebula Award. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Fritz Leiber, who died in 1992, was one of the most important SF and fantasy writers of the century. <i>The Big Time</i> is his most famous SF novel. "[His] awards for fantasy included the 1975 Grand Master of Fantasy Award, the 1976 World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement, the 1981 Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America, 6 Hugos, 4 Nebulas, and about 20 other awards.<br></p><h2>People of Kau</h2><p>Translated from the German by J.

Some expositions have excelled in scholarship, but, unlike the Psalter, in instructing the mind they have failed to exercise the heart. Dr. Plumer's Commentary avoids this defect, the author believing that from the Psalms 'piety has derived more nourishment than from any other source,' and that his work should serve that same purpose. In 1211 pages he gives both exposition and doctrinal and practical remarks and presents in readable form a great wealth of material drawn from all the leading commentators who had gone before him. In the opinion of Dr John Macleod of Edinburgh, he succeeded in producing the best single volume on this book of Scripture.<br><br>Graduating from Princeton Seminary in 1826, Plumer was a well-known Southern Presbyterian preacher and writer who spent the last thirteen years of his life as a Professor at Columbia Theological Seminary, South Carolina. He produced his exposition of the Psalms during the prime of life, and, as he tells us, 'never felt more disposed to any work.' In the opinion of others, Dr Plumer was outstanding as a spiritual Christian: 'His prayers,' wrote Moses D. Hoge, 'were the tender pleadings of a soul in communion with God.' Of the place which the Psalms had in his own experience he writes: 'During a Christian and ministerial life, neither short, uneventful, nor free from dark days and sharp sorrows, the author has never been able to secure to himself, or administer to others, full support and abounding consolation without a resort to the Psalms.'</p><p>Minister, author, and theological professor, William Swan Plumer (1802-80) was one of Princeton Theological Seminary's most well-known students. Born in Griersburg, Pennsylvania, Plumer would graduate from Washington College in Virginia in 1825. Following a year of study at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1826, Plumer began a very active and diverse ministerial career.<br><br>During the first several years of Plumer's ministry he helped organize and found churches in Danville, Virginia and Warrenton, North Carolina. After several years of itinerant preaching ministry, he served as a resident pastor in Petersburg, Virginia from 1831 to 1834, and in Richmond, Virginia between the years of 1835 and 1846. During his Richmond pastorate, Plumer founded a religious weekly, the Watchman of the South, and an institution to assist the deaf, dumb, and blind.<br><br>In 1847, Plumer accepted a pastoral call to Baltimore, Maryland. After eight years of ministry with the congregation there, Plumer became pastor of a church in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where he also served as a professor at Western Theological Seminary. Plumer relocated to the Philadelphia area in the mid-1860s. He assisted a congregation in Pottsville, 1865-66, at which time he received appointment to serve as Professor of Didactic and Polemic Theology at Columbia Theological Seminary in Columbia, South Carolina. He served in this position until 1875, when he was transferred to the chair of Historic, Casuistic, and Pastoral Theology. He held this position until shortly before his death.<br><br>Plumer was a prolific author and active churchman. His published works include commentaries, biblical studies, articles, essays, sermons, and a volume on pastoral theology. His writings, while profoundly theological in nature, are very practical in focus. A number of his books have remained in print; they represent a high point in the theological-devotional literature produced of nineteenth century American Presbyterianism.<br><br>As a churchman, Plumer had the rare distinction of serving as Moderator of the General Assembly of the undivided Presbyterian denomination (1838) and of its southern branch (1871). In his life and work, William S. Plumer embodied Princeton Theological Seminary s vision for an intelligent and informed piety that rested on the theological foundations of Scripture and the Westminster Standards.</p><h2>Wanderlust : A History of Walking</h2><p>With profiles of some of the most significant walkers in history and fiction - from Wordsworth to Andre Breton&#39;s Nadja - Wanderlust offers a pastoral and poetic investigation of the interplay between the body, the imagination, and the world around the walker. Solnit argues passionately for the preservation of the time and space in which to walk in an ever-more car dependent and accelerated world.</p><p>The ability to walk on two legs over long distances distinguishes <i>Homo sapiens</i> from other primates, and indeed from every other species on earth. That ability has also yielded some of the best creative work of our species: the lyrical ballads of the English romantic poets, composed on long walks over hill and dale; the speculations of the peripatetic philosophers; the meditations of footloose Chinese and Japanese poets; the exhortations of Henry David Thoreau and Walt Whitman.<p> Rebecca Solnit, a thoughtful writer and spirited walker, takes her readers on a leisurely journey through the prehistory, history, and natural history of bipedal motion. Walking, she observes, affords its practitioners an immediate reward--the ability to observe the world at a relaxed gait, one that allows us to take in sights, sounds, and smells that we might otherwise pass by. It provides a vehicle for much-needed solitude and private thought. For the health-minded, walking affords a low-impact and usually pleasant way of shedding a few pounds and stretching a few muscles. It is an essential part of the human adventure--and one that has, until now, been too little documented.</p><p> Written in a time when landscapes and cities alike are designed to accommodate automobiles and not pedestrians, Solnit's extraordinary book is an enticement to lace up shoes and set out on an aimless, meditative stroll of one's own. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Rebecca Solnit, author of A book of Migrations, Savage Dreams, and Secret Exhibition, has written about visual art, public space, landscape, and environmental issues for magazines and for museums ranging from New York&#39;s Whitney to the Denver Art Museum.

Now, the foremost historian of the care of the mentally ill compellingly recounts our various attempts to solve this ever-present dilemma.<br>In the first comprehensive one-volume history of the treatment of the mentally ill, Gerald Grob begins with colonial America, when families and local communities accepted responsibility for their mentally ill members. Their solutions varied, from confinement under lock and key, to granting mentally ill persons a wide measure of autonomy. As American society grew larger and more complex, the first mental hospitals were created to deal with growing numbers of the severely and persistently mentally ill. Grob brings to life the charismatic and innovative individuals who administered these hospitals and shows how they were successful at first in providing humane care and treatment.<br>But under the pressure of too many patients and too few resources, the hospitals subsequently deteriorated into custodial institutions, and Grob charts this transformation. He traces the growth of the psychiatric profession, the change of the mental health field during World War Il, and the use of controversial shock therapies, drugs, and lobotomies. Mounting criticism of some of these techniques and of mental institutions as inhumane places led to the emptying of the hospitals and a new emphasis on community care and treatment.<br>Americans daily encounter the pitiful sight of homeless, mentally ill people in the streets of our cities, and wonder how it came to be this way. Grob shows that while many patients benefited from the new community policies, there arose a new group of mentally ill substance abusers who desperately need treatment but who resist it. He argues that these people, and not deinstitutionalized patients, make up most of the disturbed homeless who confront us today. Their presence demands new solutions, and Grob's definitive history points the way. It is at once an indispensable reference and a call for a humane and balanced policy in the future.</p><p>In the first comprehensive one-volume history of the treatment of the mentally ill, the foremost historian in the field compellingly recounts out various attempts to solve this ever-present dilemma from colonial times to the present.Gerald N.

Oneness provides ways to imagine and achieve a more expansive conception of the self as fundamentally connected with other people, creatures, and things. Such views present profound challenges to Western hyperindividualism and its excessive concern with self-interest and tendency toward self-centered behavior.<br><br>This anthology presents a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary exploration of the nature and implications of the oneness hypothesis. While fundamentally inspired by East and South Asian traditions, in which such a view is often critical to their philosophical approach, this collection also draws upon religious studies, psychology, and Western philosophy, as well as sociology, evolutionary theory, and cognitive neuroscience. Contributors trace the oneness hypothesis through the works of East Asian and Western schools, including Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, Buddhism, and Platonism and such thinkers as Zhuangzi, Kant, James, and Dewey. They intervene in debates over ethics, cultural difference, identity, group solidarity, and the positive and negative implications of metaphors of organic unity. Challenging dominant views that presume that the proper scope of the mind stops at the boundaries of skin and skull, <i>The Oneness Hypothesis</i> shows that a more relational conception of the self is not only consistent with contemporary science but has the potential to lead to greater happiness and well-being for both individuals and the larger wholes of which they are parts.</p><p>Philip J.

Paul Getty to his heirs and the Getty Oil Co., only to learn hours later that New York-based Texaco had beaten them out. The ensuing legal battle, in which Pennzoil initially won an unprecedented $10.3 billion judgment, is vividly detailed here in a thriller-style chronicle by a Houston staffer for the Wall Street Journal. Petzinger's financial, juridical and cultural saga pits North against South, East vs. West, handshake-honor wildcatter against Wall Streeters, with Getty heirs stirring confusion and lawyers slugging it out in a court struggle that still goes on. (Texaco has requested a new trial.) A must for the oil industry and stock-market crowd and a highly instructive entertainment for everyone else. First serial to the Wall Street Journal. (June <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.This book reads more like fiction than like a narrative of actual events leading to headline-making litigation. It describes in gripping detail Texaco's break-up of the merger between Pennzoil and Getty Oil. The Texas jury awarded damages against Texaco in the astronomical sum of $11 billion. The company has since filed for bankruptcy. The case is rumbling through the appellate process. While the Wall Street Journal and other newspapers have reported thoroughly on the proceedings, this book does a marvellous job of assembling all the facts in one place. The reader gets an inside look at the rarefied world of takeover artists, slick investment bankers, and crafty lawyers. Recommended for public libraries. M.

But not apparently from the mind of the newspaper mogul's granddaughter, who, with coauthor Biddle (Beneath the Wind), pens this tale based on that murder. Described with brio is the relationship between Hearst and his silent screen-star mistress, Marion Davies, whom the publisher kept a virtual prisoner at the castle where she took revenge by throwing wild parties and having assorted, barely concealed affairs. At their best when cataloguing the beauties and excesses of San Simeon, the authors are less successful with fictional character, Catha Kinsolving Burke. The story opens at the funeral of Catha's estranged mother. Catha is astonished to learn that her mother wished to have her ashes sprinkled at San Simeon. After honoring the request, Catha tours the estate and overhears a conversation that implicates her grandmother, personal assistant to Marion Davies, in a murder. The rest of the story alternates between Catha's search for information about her grandmother's real role in the murder and a recreation of life at San Simeon in the '20s. Catha's present-day angst just can't compete against the passions and other extravagances of Hearst's heyday: her mystery merely provides pallid packaging for the still lurid and juicy true-life one. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.Legendary Hollywood producer Thomas Ince's 1924 death aboard news magnate William Randolph Hearst's yacht Oneida has long been listed officially as accidental--a heart attack brought on by acute indigestion--but dark rumors have circulated for just as long. Now along comes Hearst's granddaughter, partnered by historical yachting fantasist Biddle (Beneath the Wind, 1993), to clear the air. Or rather to muddy it more than ever, since Prof. Catha Kinsolving Burke, visiting Hearst's palatial San Simeon to scatter her late mother's ashes, gets wind of a rumor that her grandmother shot Ince--and sets out to clear her of charges no historian's ever made, since Abigail Kinsolving, secretary to Hearst inamorata Marion Davies, is as fictional as Catha herself. And she's a whole lot more fictional than the other suspects- -Hearst, Davies, Charlie Chaplin, Lita Grey, Pola Negri, John Barrymore, Louella Parsons, and Elinor Glyn--aboard the Oneida. Though the cast is glittering, the plotting isn't; Catha has to spend well over half the novel figuring out why anybody would've suspected Abigail of murder before she can team up with an eligible L.A. lawyer to vindicate her. Still, there's a certain charm in watching Patricia Hearst's demure fictional counterpart working like a beaver to get the lowdown on a crime 70 years away from her own sweet self. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He, too, is an author. Edward is in love with a woman, Willow, who's married to a man Edward loathes, and who loathes him, but he and Willow stay close friends. She's an artist. As Madeleine develops the plot, Edward attends a gallery show where a scummy critic is flung down a flight of fire stairs...murdered. Madeleine, still stressed from her miscarriages and grieving her inability to have a child, grows more and more enamored of Edward, spending more and more time with him and the progress of the investigation and less with her physician husband, Hugh, who in turn may be developing secrets of his own.</p><p>As Madeline engages more with Edward, he begins to engage back. A crisis comes when Madeleine chooses the killer in Edward's story and Hugh begins to question her immersion in her novel. Yet <em>Crossing the Lines</em> is not about collecting clues and solving crimes. Rather it's about the process of creation, a gradual undermining of the authority of the author as the act of writing spirals away and merges with the story being told, a self-referring narrative crossing over boundaries leaving in question who to trust, and who and what is true.</p><p>For fans of Paul Auster, Jesse Kellerman, Vera Caspary's Laura, Martin Amis, Haruki Murakami, Marisha Pessl</p></p><p><p>After setting out to study astrophysics, graduating in law and then abandoning her legal career to write books, Sulari now grows French black truffles on her farm in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains of NSW.

(<i><b>Jeffery Deaver</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author</i>)<br><br>"<i>Crossing the Lines</i> is a new entry in a small sub-genre of metafiction in which we not only see writers at their craft but also see lines between reality and fiction blend so far that the fourth wall is just a distant speck in the rearview mirror." (Annie Smith <i><b>NetGalley</b></i>)<br><br>"...<i>Crossing the Lines</i> is a worthwhile read." (Katrina Niidas Holm <i><b><i>Mystery Scene Magazine</i></b></i>)<br><br>"<i>Crossing the Lines</i> is a book that smiles and offers cake while it thinks. Sulari Gentill delivers ideas and narrative entertainment, and it's a bonus that her novel is also sub-acidly satirical." (Robyn Walton <i><b><i>The Australian</i></b></i>)<br><br>"Fans of postmodern fiction will enjoy this departure from Gentill's 1930s series (<i>Miles Off Course</i>, etc.). It's an exploration, as one character puts it, of 'an author's relationship with her protagonist, an examination of the tenuous line between belief and reality, imagination and self, and what happens when that line is crossed.'" (Ian Littauer <i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i>)<br><br>"A delightful, cerebral novel featuring a crime writer who grows dangerously enamored with her main character. As the interplay between creator and created reaches Russian-nesting-doll complexity, it forces us to question the nature of fiction itself." (<i><b>Gregg Hurwitz</b>, <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Orphan X</i> and <i>The Nowhere Man</i></i>)<br><br>"Literary or pop fiction lovers will enjoy" (<i><b><i>Library Journal</i></b></i>)<br><br>"This is an elegant exploration of the creative process, as well as a strong defense of the crime-fiction genre, as Gentill illustrates the crossing of lines between imagination and reality. Rich with insights that can add pleasure to the reading of crime fiction." (Michele Leber <i><b><i>Booklist</i></b></i>)</p><h2>Yes Prime Minister, Vol. 1: The Diaries of the Right Hon.

Martha Holmberg was trained at La Varenne and is an award-winning food writer. Her look at this sometimes-intimidating genre-expressed in clear, short bites of information and through dozens of process photographs-delivers the skill of great sauce-making to every kind of cook, from beginners to those more accomplished who wish to expand their repertoire. More than 100 recipes for sauces range from standardssuch as bearnaise, hollandaise, and marinara to modern riffs such as maple-rum sabayon, caramelized onion coulis, and coconut-curry spiked chocolate sauce. An additional 55 recipes use the sauces to their greatest advantage, beautifying pasta, complementing meat or fish, or elevating a cake to brilliant. Modern Sauces is both an inspiration and a timeless reference on kitchen technique.</p><p>"Modern Sauces is my favorite book this year. It is destined to be a classic reference for the rest of my cooking life, on one of the most valuable but least understood facets of cooking: sauces. Martha Holmberg brings great intelligence and lucid writing and instructions to the important craft of sauces. She is both respectful of and illuminating about classic sauces, innovative in her thinking about contemporary sauces, and practical in terms of everyday cooking. This is a great book." - Michael Ruhlman, author of Twenty, Ratio and Salumi<br><br>"Here's a book you'll use every day whether you're tossing together a quick salad or creating a dessert for a gala. Martha Holmberg's truly modern (read: simple, fast and tasty) sauces pump up the flavor and excitement of every dish. Think of these sauces as a culinary bag of tricks . I do." - Dorie Greenspan, author of Around My French Table<br><br>"Food writer, editor, and Paris-trained chef Holmberg (Crepes) believes sauces are an integral part of everyday cooking. With these 100-plus recipes, organized by ingredient and method (e.g., Vinaigrettes, Chocolate Sauces), she shows readers that sauce-making doesn't have to be tedious. In a clear and encouraging voice, she explains how to season, store, portion, and improvise on classic sauces that elevate such dishes as Fried Eggs with Garlicky Chard and Saffron-Red Pepper Hollandaise and Simple and Delicious Enchiladas. VERDICT Easily Holmberg's best cookbook to date, this uses delicious recipes-like the outstanding Rice Pudding with Cardamom Meringues, Lime Cr�me Anglaise, and Chunky Mixed-Berry Coulis-to put essential skills in context." - Library JournalMartha Holmberg is an award winning food writer and editor who developed expert sauce-making techniques as assistant to Anne Willan at La Varenne Cooking School in France, then as the publisher and editor of Fine Cooking Magazine and most recently, as the food editor of the Oregonian newspaper.

The first section of the book covers the basic sources, those which will have the widest application for researchers who are new to the business of tracing family roots. Part two examines sources which have a narrower application, while part three is a reference guide which allows access to a range of research materials, including county by county source lists, printed family histories, occupations and Church of Ireland records.</p><p>John Grenham is a professional genealogist. He was formerly attached to the Genealogical Office in Dublin and later was a project manager with the Irish Genealogical Project (IGP).Written by a professional Irish genealogist at the Genealogical Office in Dublin, this book is the product of more than a decade of professional research. It focuses on tracing ancestors in Ireland and, while designed for researchers at different levels of experience, its intent is to provide help even for the "hard-bitten veteran." It is organized into three parts: Part 1 addresses the most basic genealogical sources (civil, census, church, and land records); Part 2 discusses more advanced tools (wills, emigration, deeds, newspapers, directories, and the Genealogical Office in Dublin); Part 3 offers a reference guide to a wide range of more fugitive resources (county source lists, printed family histories, church records, and research services, societies, and repositories). Revised editions could profit from more readable maps, more complete and current bibliographical references, an enlarged scope that includes Irish research in the United States and Canada, and a comprehensive bibliography of published sources. Still, the book provides a good beginning as a replacement for Margaret Dickson Falley's Irish and Scotch-Irish Ancestral Research (self-published, 1962). Grenham's book is by far the best work available on Irish genealogy and is essential for individuals and institutions researching the subject.

After playing key roles at the <i>Herald Tribune</i> as it battled fiercely for its survival, he joined the <i>Post</i> under the leadership of Ben Bradlee and Katharine Graham as they were building the paper's national reputation. As the <i>Post</i>'s Metropolitan editor, Rosenfeld managed Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as they broke the Watergate story, overseeing the paper's standard-setting coverage that eventually earned it the Pulitzer Prize Gold Medal for Public Service. In describing his complicated relationship with Bradlee and offering an insider's perspective on the unlikely partnership of Woodward and Bernstein, Rosenfeld depicts the tensions and challenges, triumphs and setbacks that accompanied the <i>Post</i>'s key role in Watergate, the most potent political scandal in America's history.<br>Rosenfeld also tells the gripping story of growing up in Hitler's Berlin. He saw his father taken away by the Gestapo in the middle of the night, and on Kristallnacht, the prelude to the Holocaust, he witnessed the burning of his synagogue and walked through streets littered with the shattered glass of Jewish businesses. After his family found refuge in America, his childhood experiences stayed with him and ultimately influenced his decision to make journalism his life's work.<br>At a time when newspapers and other media are under financial pressure to cut back on investigative reporting, <i>From Kristallnacht to Watergate</i> reminds us why journalism matters, and why good journalism is essential to our democracy.<br><b>Reviews:</b><br><br>"A terrific memoir by one of the great newspapermen of the era.

Users can access information on the vocabulary of astrology, signs of the zodiac, chart-casting, astrological systems of other countries, people (past and present) involved in astrology and the branches, theories and influences of astrology. Entries include: Evangeline Adams; age of aquarius; agricultural astrology; Saint Thomas Aquinas; Christianity and astrology; day horoscope; Egyptian astrology; gemstones; Icarus; Julian Day; local mean time; newspaper astrology; Sappho; sidereal time; Ronald and Nancy Reagan; Venus and zenith. Appendices provide directory listings of astrological organizations and periodicals, and a &#34;how to&#34; discussion on casting an astrological chart.</p><p>Reference books on controversial areas of knowledge such as astrology present an interesting challenge to the reviewer--and researcher--who may not agree with the foundations or tenets of the field. Although aimed at the believer, Lewis' work may be confidently consulted by the skeptic seeking basic information about astrology.<p><i>The Astrology Encyclopedia</i> presents 780 alphabetically arranged entries "intended to help today's students of astrology better understand the heavenly influences." The author, an authority on nontraditional religious movements and a professional astrologer for more than 20 years, states that it "can be used as a foundation or textbook for acquiring a basic understanding of astrology"; as such, Lewis suggests the optimal order for studying the entries. The focus here is almost entirely on natal astrology, which deals with individual personalities, as opposed to mundane astrology, which is concerned with nations and political events. Neither is Lewis much concerned with horary astrology, "the practice of casting charts for particular questions." And though they are mentioned in passing in the introduction, those astrologers perhaps best known to the newspaper-reading public--Jeanne Dixon, "Zolar" (Bruce King), Sidney Omarr, and Ophiel--are neither given main entries nor mentioned in the extensive index. The simple sun-sign astrology of newspaper horoscope columns, because it ignores other astrological influences, is given little credence here.</p><p>Entries ranging in length from one sentence to more than 15 pages include dozens of historical and contemporary astrologers, hundreds of astronomical bodies (mostly asteroids), and technical terms of astrology and astronomy. Perhaps most interesting for the casual reader are longer entries such as <i>Astrotherapy</i>, <i>Chinese Astrology</i>, <i>History of Astrology in America</i>, and <i>History of Western Astrology</i>. Hundreds of the longer entries have appended lists of sources. Many of the biographical entries are followed by a list of selected writings. Preceding the index are appendixes for casting a chart, astrological organizations and their addresses worldwide, and astrological periodicals with addresses, description of contents, and subscription information. Illustrations include black-and-white photographs and line drawings.</p><p>Although books on astrology are numerous, good astrological encyclopedias are less abundant. <i>The Astrology Encyclopedia</i> makes a fine supplement to the <i>Larousse Encyclopedia of Astrology</i> (NAL, 1980) and Eleanor Bach's <i>Astrology from A to Z: An Illustrated Source Book</i> (Philosophical Library, 1990), both of which are frequently cited in Lewis' work. <i></i></p>This comprehensive encyclopedia covers everything from astroeconomics (business astrology) and agricultural astrology (the practice of choosing the time to plant and to harvest crops) to the signs of the Zodiac. The field of astrology, long viewed with antagonism in both scientific and Christian circles, has been growing steadily over the past 100 years, with people showing a casual interest in horoscopes and a dependence on stars for major business and political decisions. Did Ronald Reagan actually consult the heavens for guidance on national policy? What are the ethical ramifications of providing astrological information for political leaders?

He does this by revisiting and drawing lessons from the history of the movement from the French revolution, through the conflicts between anarchists and Marxists, to the social revolution of 1968. These are not just abstract theoretical reflections, but are informed by the experiences of a lifetime of revolutionary commitments.</p><p><b>Daniel Gu�rin</b>&nbsp;was a prominent member of the French left for half a century. He published&nbsp;<i>The Brown Plague</i>&nbsp;in 1933 and&nbsp;<i>Fascism and Big Business</i>&nbsp;in 1936. His controversial, libertarian Marxist interpretation of the French Revolution,&nbsp;<i>Class Struggle in the First Republic, 1793&#x2013;1797</i>&nbsp;was judged by his friend C.L.R. James to be &#x201c;one of the great theoretical landmarks of our movement&#x201d;.<b>&nbsp;Mitchell Abidor</b> is the principal French translator for the Marxists Internet Archive. His translations include <i>Anarchists Never Surrender</i>, <i>Voices of the Paris Commune</i>, and <i>Death to Bourgeois Society</i>.&nbsp;<b>David Berry</b>&nbsp;is currently a senior lecturer in politics and history at Loughborough University, UK. His publications include <i>A History of the French Anarchist Movement, 1917&#x2013;1945,</i>&nbsp;<i>New Perspectives on Anarchism, Labour and Syndicalism,</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Libertarian Socialism</i>. He is currently preparing a biography of Gu�rin."Over six decades Daniel Gu�rin had a record of willingness to cooperate with any section of the French left that shared his fundamental goals of proletarian self-emancipation, colonial liberation, and sexual freedom. He was a vigorous polemicist but saw no fragment of the left, however obscure, as beneath his attention. He was also typically generous, never seeking to malign his opponents, however profoundly he disagreed with them. He was always willing to challenge orthodoxy, whether Marxist or anarchist. Yet behind the varying formulations one consistent principle remained: &#x2018;The Revolution of our age will be made from below&#x2014;or not at all.&#x2019;" &#x2014;Ian Birchall, author, <i>The Spectre of Babeuf, Sartre Against Stalinism</i>&nbsp;and <i>A Rebel&#x2019;s Guide to Lenin&nbsp;</i><br><br>"Gu�rin provides an eloquent history of libertarian socialist practice that is not just insightful but also an exemplary display of straightforward writing, passion, and balance. The book is highly valuable as a history of thought and action, to be sure, but, even more important, as an exploration of issues and ideas directly relevant to today&#x2019;s world." &#x2014;Michael Albert, author, <i>Parecon: Life after Capitalism</i><br><br>"With the continual debasing of &#x2018;libertarian&#x2019; to mean free-market capitalist, the publication in English of Daniel Gu�rin&#x2018;s classic<i> For a Libertarian Communism</i> is very welcome. It shows why Gu�rin was one of France&#x2019;s leading libertarian thinkers and activists, for it discusses what remain the key issues for socialists of all schools. His deep knowledge of both anarchism and Marxism makes this book essential reading for all radicals: Marxists will get their false notions of anarchism challenged while those interested in anarchism will see that it is libertarian socialism rather than some incoherent lifestyle choice.&#x201d; &#x2014;Iain McKay, author, <i>An Anarchist FAQ</i>, <i>Property Is Theft!</i> <i>A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Reader</i>, and <i>Direct Struggle Against Capital: A Peter Kropotkin Anthology</i><br><br>"Daniel Gu�rin is the creator of a unique synthesis between Marxism and anarchism: libertarian communism. His reflections are more than ever relevant for the 21st century." &#x2014;Michael L�wy, author, <i>Ecosocialism: A Radical Alternative to Capitalist Catastrophe</i></p><h2>Adele</h2><p>Adele: The Complete Collection presents, for the first time ever, all the songs from Adele&#39;s three chart-topping albums in a single songbook.

Lights at an odd hour. A visitor never before seen. An unfamiliar car.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the car that attracted him in the ghostly hour just before dawn. The car and the window lighted at such an unusually for this cabin, early hour. Jesse sidled between the oleander and the exterior wall to peer through the smudged window. He liked looking in from the darkness, unseen, unfelt. He liked to slip inside unlatched doors, too, when occupants were absent. He liked finding out about people.<br> &nbsp;<br> Knowing funny little facts could pay off Sometimes the payoff was slipping in the needle, the muttered comment that brought a flash of fear or fury to an unwary face.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse Penrick liked finding out about people. But he didn&#x2019;t like people.<br> &nbsp;<br> His watery, nearsighted eyes strained to see as much as possible. The wooden shutters were closed, but a broken slat afforded him a narrow field of vision, the portion of the living room that held a couple of wicker chairs and a wooden chest. As he watched, the occupant of the room came into view, carrying an awkward, lumpy bundle. The bearer dumped the load on the floor beside the wooden chest, then lifted the lid.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Jesse&#x2019;s gaze was riveted on the floor and the red-and-blue quilt&#x2014;just like one his grandmothere&#x2019;d made&#x2014;that gaped open to reveal its contents.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse could have called the police.<br> &nbsp;<br> It would have been exciting. Lights flashing. Sirens. Maybe even yellow tape like he saw sometimes in TV crime scenes. And Jesse could be a hero, interviewed on Channel 10. Hot stuff.<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead, he waited, his gnarled hands gripping the window frame. In only a few minutes, the room was empty and dark, the bundle stuffed into the chest, the lights turned off, the car departed in a swirl of dust.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jesse looked once over his shoulder, then trotted to the back of the cabin and the kitchen door he had learned to shake until the bolt slipped. He tiptoed inside. He had a little pocket flash which he aimed down at the opened chest. He tugged on the quilt. His impersonal blue eyes surveyed the interior thoughtfully, then he gave a satisfied nod. Without a qualm, he reached down and pulled. In a moment, he stared at the soft gleam of gold against his palm. That would prove he&#x2019;d been here, all right.<br> &nbsp;<br> He tucked the covering in place, closed the lid, then slid out of the house as silently as he&#x2019;d come. Be interesting to see what happened next. And it would happen pretty quick, as hot as it was. He didn&#x2019;t have to be in any hurry. But, when the time was right, he&#x2019;d make a little phone call. Be a hell of a shock. His thin mouth stretched in a wolfish grin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> TWO<br> &nbsp;<br> Thursday evening,<br> September 17<br> &nbsp;<br> Lucinda Burrows darted through the crowd, her brown alligator heels clicking excitedly against the concrete.<br> &nbsp;<br> She&#x2019;d done just as instructed, and the whole operation had gone without a hitch.<br> &nbsp;<br> She was good at this.<br> &nbsp;<br> Soon there would be more to do. Her green eyes glowed with excitement. She caught a glimpse of herself in plate glass and was pleased. She still looked young&#x2014;and tonight she felt so young. To think this fabulous week had begun with a chance conversation at her favorite bookstore. After all the years of reading about adventure, adventure had come to her. She&#x2019;d never thought it could happen!<br> &nbsp;<br> She paused once, a little daunted now, because the crowds had thinned, and she was at the far end of the long drive that led to the highway. Then lights blinked twice in the darkness beneath a line of loblolly pines.<br> &nbsp;<br> She took a tighter grip on her overnight bag and broke into an eager trot, stumbling a little in her eagerness, careening like a moth toward extinction.<br> &nbsp;<br> THREE<br> &nbsp;<br> Thursday night,<br> September 17<br> &nbsp;<br> The perfect crime.<br> &nbsp;<br> Who said it couldn&#x2019;t be done?<br> &nbsp;<br> The solitary drinker raised the champagne glass in silent toast.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>To crime.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> It was then&#x2014;and did some dark gods in a shadowy corner of the universe clasp their sides and shake with mirth?&#x2014;that the phone began to ring.</p><h2>Folk Art of Europe</h2><p>From review - &#34;The plates reproduced in this book are the same which were published in Peasant Art in Europe, 1927.

It&#x2019;s September of 2001 and for David, everything is coming up gold: Temple membership is on the rise, the new private school is raking it in, and the mortuary and cemetery&#x2015;where Cohen has been laundering bodies for the mob&#x2015;is minting cash.

Westlake while reading this witty, brutal, vital book. Goldberg is a master, expertly building upon the grim goings-on of <i>Gangsterland</i>, merrily pursuing plot points set up there to their logical, wicked ends. And, as if the impressive buildup of tension weren&#x2019;t sufficient, he ends the current installment on a cliff hanger of truly epic proportions, setting up what appears to be the forthcoming and final installment of the Gangster trilogy. This reviewer is already getting itchy, waiting for that welcome denouement." &#x2015;<i>Mystery Scene Magazine</i> <br><br> "Not only religion but family (what is the mafia if not a family?) and community are dissected in Goldberg&#x2019;s sharp satires, which also happen to be excellent crime novels." &#x2015;LitHub, 1 of 6 Crime Must-Reads This September <br><br> "[A] fast-paced, addicting novel." &#x2015;<i>San Diego City Beat</i> <br><br> "Fans of Elmore Leonard will quickly devour Tod Goldberg&#x2019;s latest novel, <i>Gangster Nation</i> . . . This worthy follow-up sees Goldberg fine-tune his signature mix of dark humor, violent crime, Talmudic wisdom and suburban satire." &#x2015;<i>Orange Coast Magazine</i> <br><br> "Written with humor and the same type of dark, up-close-and-personal style of dialogue that Don Winslow is known for, Goldberg also mixes in some eyebrow-raising historical facts about how criminals (of all types, but especially gangsters) have shaped and changed America throughout the country&#x2019;s history. A touch better than its predecessor (<i>Gangsterland</i>), Goldberg&#x2019;s latest novel is a bold and daring adventure that hits hard early on and never lets up. The story twists and turns its way to a surprising ending, setting things up nicely for the planned third and final book in the Sal Cupertine trilogy, The Death of a Gangster." &#x2015;<i>The Real Book Spy</i> <br><br> "While <i>Gangster Nation</i> contains a great deal of humor, at least when talking about the members of the synagogue, the novel takes a more serious turn after the events of 9/11 . . . The novel&#x2019;s cliff-hanger ending . . . will leave readers eager to discover what happens next." &#x2015;<i>The Reporter Group</i><br><br> "Goldberg&#x2019;s new novel is every bit as entertaining and at least as quirky as its predecessor&#x2015;not an out-and-out comedy but certainly lighter than most books featuring organized crime figures and crazed law enforcers (although there are moments of memorable darkness). The book can be read as an installment in a series or as a stand-alone; Goldberg provides enough background to allow newbies to pick up the important plot threads." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "The sequel conducts extended discussions on how America is defined by crime, boldly linking gangland violence to the 9/11 attacks . . . Sal/David's mixing of Talmudic citations with Bruce Springsteen lyrics is still very funny. The sacred gets the stuffing kicked out of it by the profane in this wild and sometimes-shocking novel." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> <br><br>"Sal Cupertine is back&#x2015;and better than ever. I love this guy." &#x2015;<b>Lee Child</b> <br><br> "<i>Gangster Nation</i> is a razor. It will slice you open and reveal your insides. And like the best of Tod Goldberg's work, it'll show you everything you are at your core." &#x2015;<b>Brad Meltzer</b>, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The President's Shadow</i> <br><br> "Tod Goldberg&#x2019;s brilliant <i>Gangster Nation</i> is hilarious, complex, and a total page-turner. It&#x2019;s also a little insane, in the best possible way." &#x2015;Lisa Lutz, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Passenger</i> <br><br> <i>Gangsterland</i> was compelling in every way, and in <i>Gangster Nation</i>, its sequel, Tod Goldberg has written an enthralling portrait of consequences&#x2015;emotional, physical, moral, you name it. Amid all the expertly choreographed violence and intrigue is a moving, thought-provoking story about the fluid nature of identity, spirituality, and love. I enjoyed every page." &#x2015;Vu Tran, author of <i>Dragonfish</i> <br><br> "<i>Gangster Nation</i> punches even harder than the excellent <i>Gangsterland</i> did: against the backdrop of 9/11, everybody&#x2019;s roughed up and bleeding, and nobody&#x2019;s hiding it well. Tod Goldberg&#x2019;s weird world is getting <i>The Sopranos</i>&#x2013;good, and <i>The Sopranos</i>&#x2013;funny: he can hit you high, low, or straight in the gut. Meshugener wiseguys. It&#x2019;ll make you a better killer&#x2015;and a better rabbi.&#x201d; &#x2015;Bill Beverly, author of <i>Dodgers</i> <br><br> <b>Praise for <i>Gangsterland</i></b> <br><br>"In his plotting, dialogue, and empathy for the bad guys, Goldberg aspires to the heights of Elmore Leonard. For those who miss the master, <i>Gangsterland</i> is a high-grade substitute." &#x2015;<i>New York Times</i> <br><br> "For many of us, <i>The Godfather</i>, book or movie, ushered us into a second boyhood, teaching that the incorrigible vitality of a first-rate gangster story could temporarily inoculate us against adult sanity. For readers of a like mind, Tod Goldberg's <i>Gangsterland</i> will arrive as a gloriously original Mafia novel: 100 percent unhinged about the professionally unhinged...torridly funny...the novel swells with a spiritual but jazzy tone."&#x2015;<i>New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br> "Gangsterland explores the question: What would happen if a hitman were forced to fake being religious?...That led to the nuances of <i>Gangsterland</i>&#x2015;to not only become a page turner, but also to expand beyond that...into an environment of faith and spirituality." &#x2015;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br><br> "One of the most compelling, and repulsive, crime-fiction protagonists in a long time." &#x2015;<i>The Forward</i><br><br>"The setup is blackly comic, the plotting a tad rococo, the payoff grim but sly... Goldberg's new book is clever bordering on wise, like <i>Get Shorty</i> on antacid." &#x2015;David Kipen, <i>Los Angeles Magazine</i> <br><br> "Unlike many of his literary forebears and contemporaries, Goldberg, it seems, has not been seized by self-evisceration or self-doubt. There's no scolding messaging about universalism here, just respect for a group that looks after its own...As Rabbi Cohen observes, who wants to hear the same old stories? For those who don't, there is <i>Gangsterland</i>." &#x2015;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i> <br><br> "Not into gangster capers? The skillfully spun <i>Gangsterland</i> could convert you...a cleverly spun novel that forced me to abandon my wiseguy moratorium. Goldberg has an amusing flair for contemporary hard-boil, and he knows his crime and crime-fighting procedures." &#x2015;<i>Las Vegas Weekly</i> <br><br> "...The transformation of Cupertino into Cohen is the true joy of <i>Gangsterland</i>...a breathtaking cat-and-mouse game that forces readers to wonder which side they're on...At its heart, it's a deeply funny crime novel about the competing desires for justice and survival &#x2015; and the battle between doing what's right and doing what's necessary." &#x2015;<i>Jewish Journal</i> <br><br> "In <i>Gangsterland</i>, author Tod Goldberg has, within the well-elbowed constraints of the conventional crime narrative envelope, written an exceedingly sage and witty thriller that reveals no chinks in the armor, no narrative lines to nowhere, and with a 'look Ma, no hands' ease of invention that would have Elmore Leonard turning over in his grave to see who has taken his place as one of the best writers around." &#x2015;<i>The Rap Sheet</i> <br><br> "Tod Goldberg's wickedly dark and hilarious new book will remind you of everything you love about Walter White (or any Coen brothers antihero, for that matter)." &#x2015;<i>Purewow</i> "The Mafia plus the Torah makes for a darkly funny and suspenseful morality tale... The man can spin a good yarn." &#x2015;Edan Lepucki for <i>The Millions</i> <br><br> "...Hilarious and fast-paced... This wickedly dark and morbidly funny new novel by Goldberg is a morality tale set in a desert landscape as ruthless and barren as those who inhabit it." &#x2015;<i>Nevada Magazine</i> <br><br> "Longtime mafia hit man Sal Cupertine knows that once somebody 'dictates the terms of your survival...you're a dead man.' By that measure it would seem that Sal, the protagonist in Tod Goldberg's wise and witty new novel, <i>Gangsterland</i>, is as dead as they come...In Goldberg's story, wisdom is tempered with humor and irony." &#x2015;<i>January Magazine</i> <br><br> "Complex characters with understandable motivations distinguish this highly unusual crime novel...Goldberg injects Talmudic wisdom and a hint of Springsteen into the workings of organized crime and FBI investigative techniques and makes it all work splendidly." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, Starred Review <br><br> "Sal's transformation&#x2015;and intermittent edification&#x2015;into Rabbi Cohen is brilliantly rendered, and Goldberg's careening plot, cast of memorably dubious characters, and mordant portrait of Las Vegas make this one of the year's best hard-boiled crime novels." &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i>, Starred Review <br><br> "Clearly influenced by the great Elmore Leonard, Goldberg puts his own dry comic spin on the material...Clever plotting, a colorful cast of characters, and priceless situations make this comedic crime novel an instant classic." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i>, Starred Review <br><br> "As sharp as a straight razor. But a lot more fun. Count me a huge fan." &#x2015;Lee Child, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Personal: A Jack Reacher Novel</i> <br><br> "<i>Gangsterland</i> is rich with complex and meaty characters, but its greatest strength is that it never pulls a punch, never holds back, and never apologizes for life's absurdities. If this novel were a person, you could ask it for a bookie." &#x2015;Brad Meltzer, bestselling author of <i>The Fifth Assassin</i> <br><br> "Tod Goldberg is a one-of-a-kind writer, and this is his best novel to date. Harrowing, funny, wise, and heretical, <i>Gangsterland</i> is everything a thriller should be." &#x2015;T. Jefferson Parker, author of <i>Full Measure</i> <br><br> "Tod Goldberg has long been one of the most interesting writers around, and <i>Gangsterland</i> is his biggest and best book so far." &#x2015;Thomas Perry <br><br> "With his eye for human detail and trademark wit, as dry as a desert breeze, Tod Goldberg charts Sal Cupertine's unlikely transition from stone-cold mob hitman to Las Vegas rabbi. This tale of witness relocation-by-mob&#x2015;part Elmore Leonard, part Theatre of the Absurd&#x2015;is a compelling examination of salvation, which comes in various guises and moves in elusive ways. A wholly unique tale from a wholly unique voice." &#x2015;Gregg Hurwitz, New York Times bestselling author of <i>Don't Look Back</i> <br><br> "Infinitely readable, infinitely funny, and infinitely better than anything else you'll read this year!" &#x2015;Craig Johnson, author of the Walt Longmire Mysteries and the basis for A&amp;E's hit series <i>Longmire</i> <br><br> "Just when you thought the mafia novel was dead, Tod Goldberg breathes new life into it. <i>Gangsterland</i>, the best mafia novel in years, is a dark, funny, and smart page-turning crime story. It's also a moving, thoughtful meditation on ethics, religion, family, and a culture that eats itself. I loved this book." &#x2015;Sara Gran, author of <i>Claire DeWitt and the Bohemian Highway</i> <br><br> "<i>Gangsterland</i> is Tod Goldberg at the height of his hilarious and incisive and hell-bent powers as a writer of who we are and what we thought we wanted and how we tried to stay alive in America&#x2015;if we were insanely funny and contemplative hit men. No one does Vegas, the desert, money, and mayhem like Goldberg. I stayed up six nights in a row reading, unable to put this book down because I couldn't wait to see how he'd play each card." &#x2015;Susan Straight, author of <i>Between Heaven and Here</i> <br><br> "Let's get this part out of the way: <i>Gangsterland</i> is a thriller and provides a crackling good read for any fan of the genre. But the truth is, to call this book merely a thriller is inaccurate. It's also a whip-smart comedy, a sublime morality play, and a gleefully blasphemous investigation of what and why we worship. There's something for everyone here. Just make sure you set aside a good chunk of time, because once you start reading you won't want to stop." &#x2015;Ron Currie, Jr., author of <i>God is Dead</i> <br><br> "Brilliant find Tod Goldberg delivers a successful thriller with his <i>Gangsterland</i>.

What do we want? How should we accomplish our goals? In <i>Virtual Equality</i>, veteran activist Urvashi Vaid answers thses questions with a unique combination of visionary politics and hard-earned pragmatism.<p> Tracing the political and cultural developments since Stonewall, Baid shows that despite significant gains in visibility, most gays and lesbians remain demoralized and persecuted, second-class citizens in their own country. Vaid defines the status of gay America as one of "virtual equality," a state of conditional equality based more upon the appearance of acceptance by straight America, rather than on actual civil equality. Virtual equality grants gays access to power, but no real power; visibility, but no security from violence and discrimination; and tax bills, coupled with "no promo homo" bills, that outlaw any attempts to "promote homosexuality."</p><p> With passionate arguments and vivid anecdotes, Vaid reasons that the struggle between legitimation ("gays are the same as straights") and liberation ("gay difference can change the world") has roadblocked the gay community for generations, and that while AIDS galvanized the movement temporarily, he challenges the gay community to wake up and face the forces that divide it and to consider what gays and lesbians stand for, as individuals and as people.</p><p> Guided by a moral vision yet grounded by realpolitik, <i>Virtual Equality</i> is a call to arms for the gay and lesbian community to begin the work necessary to achieve genuine equality with the rest of America.</p><p> "In this thoughtful and noble book, one of our great leaders struggles to find answers about where we're going and how we get there. It's both a heartbreaking book a nd a hopeful one, as Vaid makes us realize the journey to gay and lesbian equality is a long and painful one and that it's a journey that must be taken by all of us. Both that journey and this book are a must." -- Larry Kramer</p><p> "Urvashi Vaid brings hard-earned wisdom to this ferociously ambitious work. Vaid doesn't preach to the choir -- or to anyone else, for that matter; she simply offers her own findings in a voice that rings with conscience and common sense. This is the best book yet about that unwieldy glacier we call The Movement." -- Armistead Maupin, author of <i>Tales Of The City</i> </p><p> "Integration versus transformation: this is a daily choice for every social justice movement. In <i>Virtual Equality</i>, Urvashi Vaid is both fair to the diversity within the gay and lesbian movement, and passionate in her advocacy of transformation. Indespensable." -- Gloria Steinam</p><p> "Vaid is a reniassance woman whose scholarship is exceeded only by her practicality. Most importantly, for where she wants to go, she is not afraid to confront the enemy from within while keeping every battle in context and focus. Hers is the stuff of realpolitik." -- Mary Matalin, Republican strategist</p>...a wise, powerfully argued work filled with vivid insights into the history of gay and lesbian liberation and containing a host of shrewd suggestions for its future. -- <i>Martin Duberman, author of <b>Stonewall</b></i><br><br>Vaid doesn't preach to the choir -- or to anyone else, for that matter; she simply offers her own findings in a voice that rings with conscience and common sense.

As Japan mourned thousands of people lost in the disaster, Mockett also grieved for her American father, who had died unexpectedly.</p><p>Seeking consolation, Mockett is guided by a colorful cast of Zen priests and ordinary Japanese who perform rituals that disturb, haunt, and finally uplift her.

From the ecstasy of a cherry blossom festival in the radiation zone to the ghosts inhabiting chopsticks, Mockett writes of both the earthly and the sublime with extraordinary sensitivity.

The inspiration for this book came initially from the collection formed by the author&#39;s mother, Dorothy Sturm, in Trinidad, during the years between 1939 and 1981. As Philip Sturm became increasingly involved with the responsibilities of caring for the family collection as well as being a keen collector himself, he discovered there were no books on the subject. He was obliged to rely on his own general knowledge, local information, an art and history background and many hours spent in the libraries and archives of Trinidad, Barbados, St. Kitts, and the Virgin Islands. Even this produced very little information, the only references coming from advertisements of furniture on packets arriving in the harbours, or from house auction sales. Accordingly, he resolved to draw upon his own experience and conduct his own detailed and leng</p><p>Philip Sturm was born and brought up in Trinidad, West Indies. He later moved to London and New York to further his education. He lived and worked for ten years in New York, joining the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art. His studies included European furniture, as a background to furthering his own knowledge of West Indian furniture which he had grown up with in Trinidad. He moved back to the Antilles, settling on St. Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, where he bought an historic property. He has published articles about West Indian antique furniture in several art magazines and has given lectures and slide shows on the subject. Over the years he has steadily put together a most comprehensive collection of Lesser Antilles furniture, adding to the pieces he inherited from his family, to form one of the largest known collections in existence. Philip has been a Board Member and President of the St. Thomas Historic Trust, Commissioner on the governmental Historic Preservation Commission, and several other boards dealing with preservation, West Indian furniture and the arts. He is also the curator and adviser on several museum boards in the Antilles.</p><h2>The Mysterious Mr. Quin (Paperback))</h2><p>From the most popular mystery writer of all time comes the story of Mr. Harley Quinn, who sparks new life into a quiet New Year&#39;s Eve party by unmasking a murderer.

Reprint.</p><p>Berent's US Air Force saga (Rolling Thunder, Steel Tiger, Phantom Leader) continues, taking his pilots and commandos into Laos and a late-1968 battle to protect a radar outpost. With only a few weeks to go before the presidential election, both the North Vietnamese and Lyndon Johnson are working on plans to swing the vote the way they want it to go. They both like Hubert Humphrey. President Johnson is getting ready to pull the plug on bombing north of the Demilitarized Zone, and the North Vietnamese are trying to choreograph the ``confession'' of a downed airman with a military action against the American radar base in Laos that controls much of the sky over their country. Recurring heroes Court Bannister and Wolf Lochert, pilot and supercommando, respectively, head for the threatened installation, pausing only for a little short, sweet, dalliance in Thailand. Meanwhile, fellow recurring hero and currently imprisoned pilot Algernon A. ``Flak'' Apple endures near-fatal beatings and psychological torture after almost escaping Hanoi. And Shawn Bannister, radical journalist, recurring villain and half-brother to Court Bannister, heads for Hanoi, unaware that he is being manipulated by Hanoi and Washington concurrently. If everything works out the way Hanoi plans, there will be dramatic revelations from the hospital in Hanoi at the very moment that either the North Vietnamese Army or their partners in socialist solidarity, the Soviets, overrun the radar. There is, by the way, a pretty but rather loose American lady hanging around the radar controls swilling gin and ogling the gents. Open your eyes for the flight and fight scenes, close them for the sex and politics. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The fourth novel in this Vietnam series (after Phantom Leader ) takes place during the fall of 1968. As a desperate President Johnson seeks to purchase goodwill by halting the bombing of North Vietnam, fighter pilot Court Bannister and Special Forces colonel Wolf Lochert team up to protect Eagle Station, a clandestine radar installation in northern Laos. These series regulars are joined by new faces, including a helicopter pilot and a para-rescue specialist, in a sequence of adventures that begins with a hair-raising aerial rescue and concludes with hand-to-hand combat against a Soviet team sent to capture the radar station. A strong subplot focuses on U.S. efforts to establish contact with POWs in North Vietnam. The author believes an intensified air campaign would have won the war and despises the politicians who refused to allow it, and his message occasionally gets in the way of his story. But the action scenes are first-rate throughout, displaying the command of detail Berent's readers have come to expect. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>SOLAR ELECTRIC HANDBOOK</h2><p>Solar Electric Handbook: Photovoltaic Fundamentals and Applications (2nd Edition) [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2013] Solar Energy International</p><p></p><h2>The Story of Human Language: The Great Courses (Literature &amp; English Language; 3 Volumes)</h2><p>Professor McWhorter covers a wealth of material, enlivened with wit and personal observations: How did different languages come to be?, Why isn&#39;t there just a single language?

Named after the migrant workers of America&#39;s Dust Bowl, these novels convey Blish&#39;s &#34;history of the future,&#34; a brilliant and bleak look at a world where cities roam the Galaxy looking for work and a sustainable way of life. In the first novel, They Shall Have Stars, man has thoroughly explored the Solar System, yet the dream of going even further seems to have died in all but one man. His battle to realize his dream results in two momentous discoveries anti-gravity and the secret of immortality. In A Life for the Stars, it is centuries later and antigravity generations have enabled whole cities to lift off the surface of the earth to become galactic wanderers. In Earthman, Come Home, the nomadic cities revert to barbarism and marauding rogue cities begin to pose a threat to all civilized worlds. In the final novel, The Triumph of Time, historyrepeats itself as the cities once again journey back in to space making a terrifying discovery which could destroy the entire Universe. A serious andhaunting vision of our world and its limits, Cities in Flight marks the return to print of one of science fiction&#39;s most inimitable writers. A Selection of the Science Fiction Book Club</p><p><i>Cities in Flight</i> is an omnibus volume of four novels, originally published between 1955 and 1962, two of which are fix-ups of pieces that first appeared in various magazines in the early '50s. Despite having been conceived more than 50 years ago, and produced in episodic fashion, they stand head and shoulders above most SF available today.<p> In <i>They Shall Have Stars</i>, humankind's will to explore space is renewed with the advent of two discoveries: anti-gravity (the "spindizzy" machines) and the key to almost eternal life (anti-agathic drugs). By <i>A Life for the Stars</i>, centuries have passed and most of the major cities have built spindizzies into their bedrock and left earth, cruising the galaxy looking for work, much like the hobos of the Depression Era. <i>Earthman, Come Home</i>, told from the perspective of John Amalfi, the major of New York, was the first-written of the novels and--although not as tightly woven as the other segments--is still a masterly work. Blish gives the same weight and authority both to the sweeping cultural change wrought and suffered by the cities, and to the emotional growth of a man who is several hundred years old. We stay with Amalfi for the final episode, <i>The Triumph of Time</i>. New York is now planet-bound in the Greater Magellanic Cloud, but when Amalfi learns of the impending destruction of time itself, he is forced into space one more time, to take a last, desperate chance. The novel ends, literally, with a bang.</p><p> Despite the occasional, inevitable anachronism, such as vacuum tubes, <i>Cities in Flight</i> stands up remarkably well to modern reading. The novel's political and literary sophistication was unmatched in its time; there is very little to rival it even today. For most readers of a certain age, this was probably the first SF they encountered that was written from a mature standpoint and adult sensibility.

One of the firefighters notices the use of accelerant at the scene and calls the police, but by the time Inspector Banks arrives, the fire brigade have put out the flames and only the smoldering wreckage remains. A body has been found on each barge, and all the evidence points towards a deliberate arson attack. </p><p>One of the victims is Tina, a young girl with a drug addiction and a terrible past who had been living with her boyfriend Mark. The other is Tom, an artist who had been living alone. Now, with little evidence to go on and a number of possible suspects, including Tina's boyfriend, the local 'lock-keeper' who reported the fire, and Tina's own father, Banks must begin to delve into the lives of the victims, and to discover who could have wanted them out of the way forever...</p><p>From the master of psychological suspense, Peter Robinson, comes a mind-bending thriller of secrets and murder.</p></p><p>One of the principle pleasures to be found in reading any of Peter Robinson's more recent British suspense novels is to see how dexterously this author uses seemingly small, confined crimes to wedge open much larger troves of hidden or historical chicanery. In <i>Playing with Fire</i>, the plot catalyst is a blaze that consumes two rotting barges moored in a Yorkshire canal, killing their squatter inhabitants--Tina Aspern, a pretty, teenage heroin abuser, and Thomas McMahon, a once-promising but "derivative" landscape painter who'd fallen on hard times. Accident or arson? The best suspects, in either event, may be Tina&#x2019;s cheating boyfriend, Mark Siddons, and a rumored peeping tom who'd taken his time--and more--reporting the conflagration. However, as Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks and his colleague and ex-lover, Annie Cabbot (both last seen in <i>Close to Home</i>), gather together the disparate threads of this case, new questions arise, suggesting that the inferno was intended to cover up still worse misdeeds. Why, for instance, had McMahon been buying old books and prints from an Eastvale antiquarian dealer? Is it true, as an angry Siddons alleges, that Tina had turned to drugs in order to blot out the pain of her stepfather's carnal advances? And what tie, if any, is there between these boat burnings and the subsequent torching of a trailer home occupied by a "quiet bloke," who perished while in possession of an unknown and potentially valuable J.M.W. Turner watercolor?<p> As attentive as Robinson is to plot progression, spicing up his narrative with arcane knowledge about fire accelerants and competition in the painting biz ("The art world's brutal," Banks is warned early on in this story), he doesn't forget that a substantial part of the attraction of this series derives from its two evolving main characters. The contemplative, jazz-loving Banks, worried by the superficiality of his latest relationship, with a "wounded" fellow cop, finds himself increasingly jealous here of Annie's suave new boyfriend, an art researcher whose past may be short a few brushstrokes. At the same time, Annie is drawn hesitantly closer again to Banks by tragic circumstances. Although Robinson's subplot about Tina's sexual violation concludes in a rather B-movieish way, <i>Playing with Fire</i> is redeemed by its scorching climax and suggestively ragged denouement. Peter Robinson, together with Ian Rankin, Reginald Hill, and others, is reinvigorating the British police procedural. <i>--J. Kingston Pierce</i></p><p><em></em></p><blockquote><em>Fire. It violently destroys futures and pasts in a terrified heartbeat, devouring damning secrets while leaving even greater mysteries in its foul wake of ash and debris.</em></blockquote><p></p><p>The night sky is ablaze as fire engulfs two barges moored end to end on a Yorkshire canal. On board are the blackened remains of two human beings. One was a reclusive and eccentric local artist, the other a junkie, a sad and damaged young girl.</p><p>To the seasoned eye of Inspector Alan Banks, this horror was no accident, its method so cruel and calculated that only the worst sort of fiend could have committed the dark act. And it isn't long before the fears of Banks and D.I. Annie Cabbot are brutally confirmed, when another suspicious blaze incinerates a remote trailer in the countryside . . . and another solitary life is gruesomely consumed.</p><p>But is it the work of a serial arsonist, or an ingeniously conceived plot to obliterate the trail to other heinous crimes? There are shocking secrets to be uncovered in the charred wreckage, grim evidence of lethal greed and twisted hunger, and of nightmare occurrences within the private confines of family. A terrible suspicion that a killer's work is not yet done drives Alan Banks as the hunt intensifies for an elusive, cold-blooded chameleon who could be anyone and anywhere.</p><p>In <em>Playing with Fire,</em> award-winning, internationally bestselling author Peter Robinson delivers a modern masterwork of suspense that confirms his standing as one of the brightest literary lights in crime fiction -- a blistering tale of murder and betrayal that is as frightening, devastating, and hypnotic as flame itself.</p></p><h2>Muscle Testing: Your Way to Health Using Emotions, Nutrition and Massage</h2><p>Methods to use for individual health problems based on muscle testing which can safely be done by the beginner.

Legend says they originated from a long lost Spanish galleon. This centuries-old tradition is remembered every year when 50,000 tourists descend on the island of Chincoteague to witness the annual pony swim and auction. On September 5, 1750, a Spanish warship named La Galga drove ashore on Assateague and came to rest close to shore and partially submerged. Her captain described her location as within two ship lengths of the Maryland and Virginia boundary. These precise directions seduced many in the future who would choose to seek her remains. In 1947, Marguerite Henry, wrote Misty of Chincoteague, a fictional account of real people of Chincoteague and a beautiful young pony named Misty. Her story documents the shipwreck legend that she was told of during her stay on the island. In 1961, 20th Century Fox released the movie based on this book. In 1980, the author was convinced like others that he could easily locate the wreck of La Galga after researching American and Spanish archives. He made no connection with the legend of the wild horses and La Galga as they had been attributed to another ship called the San Lorenzo. But that ship was the invention of a convincing con man. Soon, the author found himself in a federal courthouse where the State of Maryland had laid claim to the fictitious wreck. Maryland s attorney general fought to keep the author s evidence of the fraud out of the public record. The make-believe ship was awarded to the state based solely on a fraudulent affidavit. Now, armed with knowledge of the shipwreck legend obtained from a descendant of an Assateague Indian and great nephew of a real life character in Misty of Chincoteague, the author's search for La Galga resumes, not in the ocean, but on the sands and marshes of Assateague where he discovers that the ship s remains are hidden in a forgotten inlet. After discovery, the author informed the public and the federal government about the wreck's location. Federal officials declined his offer to demonstrate the discovery made in the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge. In 1998, a treasure hunter claimed he had located La Galga in 20 feet of water just off the deserted beaches of Assateague. But at the end of the litigation, all parties had to admit that they did not know where the wreck really was. In spite of this, and at the insistence of the federal government, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia awarded La Galga to the Kingdom of Spain. Today, that case is being cited as precedent by the Kingdom of Spain in its attempt to lay claim to treasure from other Spanish shipwrecks. The Hidden Galleon at last documents nearly three decades of dramatic and bizarre events related to the real story of a lost Spanish warship and the wild ponies of Assateague Island. <b>Named Finalist in the History/Historical Non-Fiction category AND <i>The Hidden Galleon,</i> was named a WINNER in the Regional Non-Fiction category of the 2008 Next Generation Indie Book Awards!</b></p><p>John Amrhein made his first dive at the age of 14, where he became enchanted with the underwater world.

He is currently a real estate broker on the Outer Banks of North Carolina where he resides with his wife and daughter.Anyone who's interested in searching for sunken treasure or investing in it should read The Hidden Galleon. The author faced every state and federal law for shipwreck claims in his battle to expose fraud and verify the location of La Galga, a 1750 Spanish warship.

The Hidden Galleon is destined to become an adult classic for the millions of us who always believed in Grandpa Beebe and the mysterious Spanish shipwreck. - --Ann Buskirk, English Department, Frostburg State University</p><h2>Mommy Knows Worst: Highlights from the Golden Age of Bad Parenting Advice</h2><p><b>Don&#x2019;t throw out the baby with the bathwater!</b><br>Ahhhh, the 1940s and &#x2019;50s . . . a time when parents everywhere strove for the American Dream&#x2014;manicured lawns, a shiny car in the driveway, and perfect children playing in the yard.

Wood's retelling of the story finds Young Robin Redbreast awakening Mother Earth's brood in early spring and follows the Root Children through their annual "masquerade" a frolic through the seasons with Aunt Spring, Cousin Summer and Uncle Fall until it's time for them to return once again to their home beneath the ground "for their long winter's nap." The tale's timeless themes of renewal and rebirth have lost none of their resonance, but the narrative bogs down somewhat in old-fashioned cadences that may be a nod to the source but come off as slightly forced ("May love and happiness follow wherever you may bloom"). Bittinger's hazy, soft-focus oil paintings suffer the same fate. Technically skillful (his animals are exquisite), with delicate brushwork and a comely use of light and shadow, the portraits of the multicultural cast of cherubs, decked out in butterfly wings and floral garlands, falter when the brushwork drifts into the kind of calculated lushness found in Thomas Kinkade paintings.

As a young black man in the Chicago of the '30s, he has no way out of the walls of poverty and racism that surround him, and after he murders a young white woman in a moment of panic, these walls begin to close in. There is no help for him--not from his hapless family; not from liberal do-gooders or from his well-meaning yet naive friend Jan; certainly not from the police, prosecutors, or judges. Bigger is debased, aggressive, dangerous, and a violent criminal. As such, he has no claim upon our compassion or sympathy. And yet...<p> A more compelling story than <i>Native Son</i> has not been written in the 20th century by an American writer. That is not to say that Richard Wright created a novel free of flaws, but that he wrote the first novel that successfully told the most painful and unvarnished truth about American social and class relations. As Irving Howe asserted in 1963, "The day <i>Native Son</i> appeared, American culture was changed forever. It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture."</p><p> Other books had focused on the experience of growing up black in America--including Wright's own highly successful <i>Uncle Tom's Children</i>, a collection of five stories that focused on the victimization of blacks who transgressed the code of racial segregation. But they suffered from what he saw as a kind of lyrical idealism, setting up sympathetic black characters in oppressive situations and evoking the reader's pity. In <i>Native Son</i>, Wright was aiming at something more. In Bigger, he created a character so damaged by racism and poverty, with dreams so perverted, and with human sensibilities so eroded, that he has no claim on the reader's compassion: </p><blockquote>"I didn't want to kill," Bigger shouted. "But what I killed for, I am! It must've been pretty deep in me to make me kill! I must have felt it awful hard to murder.... What I killed for must've been good!" Bigger's voice was full of frenzied anguish. "It must have been good! When a man kills, it's for something... I didn't know I was really alive in this world until I felt things hard enough to kill for 'em. It's the truth..."</blockquote> Wright's genius was that, in preventing us from feeling pity for Bigger, he forced us to confront the hopelessness, misery, and injustice of the society that gave birth to him. <i>--Andrew Himes</i><p>Right from the start, Bigger Thomas had been headed for jail. It could have been for assault or petty larceny; by chance, it was for murder and rape. <em>Native Son</em> tells the story of this young black man caught in a downward spiral after he kills a young white woman in a brief moment of panic. Set in Chicago in the 1930s, Wright's powerful novel is an unsparing reflection on the poverty and feelings of hopelessness experienced by people in inner cities across the country and of what it means to be black in America.</p></p><h2>The Innovator&#39;s Guide to Growth: Putting Disruptive Innovation to Work</h2><p>More than a decade ago, Clayton Christensen's breakthrough book <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i> illustrated how disruptive innovations drive industry transformation and market creation.

Everest with no Sherpa assistance. Purposefully abstaining also from bottled oxygen, computers, and radios, while establishing an historic new route. In 1988, American climber Ed Webster's 4-man team achieved this ultimate Everest ascent, years before the Into Thin Air tragedy. Now delve into Webster's 5-Star reader-rated Everest classic, Snow in the Kingdom, illustrated by 100 pages of stunning color photographs. ( Or sneak preview "Everest The Really Hard Way" at youtube.com/watch?v=zjAHkTHn4fA )<br>Almost 30 years ago, in a climbing style never seen again on Everest, four partners from America, Canada, and England pioneered a super-dangerous new route (the Neverest Buttress) up the avalanche-blasted precipices of the remote, nearly forgotten Kangshung East Face of Mt. Everest in Tibet. Perhaps most remarkably, not wanting to endanger the lives of any Sherpas, the climbers carried every ounce of gear and food themselves. Only one person summited. This small team's indomitable willpower to succeed, their bravery, mutual trust, and teamwork have become legendary. But days without food plus severe frostbite were the painful prices of victory and survival.</p><p>Physical Description: 6 x 9.25 inches, hard back, color laminated dust jacket, 580 pages printed on high-quality coated paper. Also included are 150 pages of color photographs, 282 black and white photos, maps of Asia and the Tibetan Plateau, 3 climbing route maps of Everest&#x2019;s three faces, and 8 Everest climbing route photo-diagrams."Snow in the Kingdom is at last published. After 12 years of effort, here it is ! The finest accolade that my teammates, Robert Anderson, Stephen Venables, and Paul Teare and I received came from Reinhold Messner, the world&#x2019;s greatest mountaineer, who unequivocally stated that our Everest Kangshung Face climb was "the best ascent of Everest in terms and style of pure adventure." It most certainly was the adventure of our lives &#x2014;&nbsp;and fortunately we survived!

Deckard travels this oedipal path in <i>Blade Runner</i> (1982) when he learns that he might be the enemy he has been ordered to pursue. Ecological awareness takes this shape because ecological phenomena have a loop form that is also fundamental to the structure of how things are.<br><br>The logistics of agricultural society resulted in global warming and hardwired dangerous ideas about life-forms into the human mind. Dark ecology puts us in an uncanny position of radical self-knowledge, illuminating our place in the biosphere and our belonging to a species in a sense that is far less obvious than we like to think. Morton explores the logical foundations of the ecological crisis, which is suffused with the melancholy and negativity of coexistence yet evolving, as we explore its loop form, into something playful, anarchic, and comedic. His work is a skilled fusion of humanities and scientific scholarship, incorporating the theories and findings of philosophy, anthropology, literature, ecology, biology, and physics. Morton hopes to reestablish our ties to nonhuman beings and to help us rediscover the playfulness and joy that can brighten the dark, strange loop we traverse.</p><p>A philosophical and historical account of our ecological crisis and a roadmap for the way forward.Timothy Morton is Rita Shea Guffey Chair in English at Rice University. His books include <i>Ecology Without Nature</i> (2007);<i> The Ecological Thought </i>(2010); <i>Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World</i> (2013); and<i> Realist Magic: Objects, Ontology, Causality</i> (2013); and he has published more than 150 essays on ecology, philosophy, art, literature, music, architecture, and food.

Though she loved the spirituality the church provided, she knew that, because of sexism, homophobia, and manipulative religious politics, established religious institutions weren&#x2019;t always holy or safe. Instead of offering refuge, these institutions have betrayed people&#x2019;s hearts and souls. &#x201c;People have suffered religious abuse,&#x201d; she writes, &#x201c;which can be different from physical injury or psychological trauma.&#x201d;</p><p>Though participation and affiliation in traditional religious institutions is waning, many people still believe in God. Merritt contends that many leave the church because they have lost trust in the institution, not in God. <em>Healing Spiritual Wounds</em> addresses the church&#x2019;s dichotomous image&#x2014;as a safe space and as a dangerous place&#x2014;and provides a way to restore personal faith and connection to God for those who have been hurt or betrayed by established institutions of faith. Merritt lays out a multistage plan for moving from pain to spiritual rebirth, from recovering theological and emotional shards to recovering communal wholeness. </p><p>Merritt does not sugarcoat the wrongs institutions long seen as trustworthy have inflicted on many innocent victims. Sympathetic, understanding, and deeply positive, she offers hope and a way to help them heal and reclaim the spiritual joy that can make them whole again.</p></p><p><p> Rev.

He loves the way her eyes light up when she laughs. And the way her long, black hair moves when she turns her head. Most of all, he loves to imagine what it would be like to kiss her.

They have also both written for television.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> "One Sigourney Weaver and one Will Smith." Liz Ortecho slid two thick burgers onto the table -- one with avocado and sprouts, one with jalape�o peppers and cheese. </p><p> Then she waited. The customers in the booth were obviously tourists. And every tourist who came to the Crashdown Cafe had at least one question about...the Roswell Incident. </p><p> "So is your family from around here?" the guy in the <i>Lost in Space</i> T-shirt asked. The blond woman sitting across from him flipped open a battered notebook and stared at Liz. </p><p> "Yeah," Liz said. "My great-great-great-grandfather inherited a ranch outside town. My family's been in Roswell ever since." </p><p> The woman uncapped her pen. The man cleared his throat. Here it comes, Liz thought. </p><p> "So did any of your relatives ever tell you any stories about, you know, the UFO crash?" the guy asked. </p><p> These two were a total trip. I bet they have every episode of <i>The X-Files</i> on tape, Liz thought. </p><p> "Well..." Liz hesitated. "I guess it would be okay to show you." She pulled a worn black-and-white photo out of her pocket and gently placed it in front of them. "A friend of my grandmother's took this picture at the crash site -- before the government cleaned it up." </p><p> The two tourists leaned over the blurry photo and studied it carefully. </p><p> "Whoa," the woman mumbled. "Whoa." </p><p> "This looks exactly like the alien from the autopsy video," the guy exclaimed. "Same oversized head and small, hairless body. I've got to get it on my Roswell Incident web site." He reached for the photo. </p><p> "You'd be dead by the end of the week." Liz snatched the photo away. "Just because its been more than fifty years since the crash doesn't mean the air force wants the truth exposed. They still want everyone to believe that weather balloon story they used as a cover-up," she explained. </p><p> Liz glanced around the cafe nervously. She wanted to make sure her father wasn't in earshot. If Papa heard her telling this story, he'd rip off her head and feed it to her for breakfast. </p><p> "I shouldn't have shown this to you. Just forget about it, okay? You never saw it." Liz rushed back behind the counter. </p><p> Maria DeLuca shook her head, sending her blond curls flying around her face. "You are so bad." </p><p> "Hey, they'll have a great story to tell when they get home. And I'll have a great tip," Liz answered. </p><p> Maria sighed. "You and your great tips. I've never known such a money-hungry waitress." </p><p> Liz shrugged. "You know how I feel. I need as much money as I can get because --" </p><p> "One day after grad it's <i>adios</i> and <i>hasta la vista,</i> baby," Maria interrupted. "I know, I know You're not going to spend your life in a town that has two movie theaters, one bowling alley, one lame-o comedy club, one even more lame-o dance club, and thirteen alien-theme tourist traps. </p><p> Liz had to smile. Her best friend did an almost perfect impression of her. "I guess I say that a lot, huh?" </p><p> Maria grabbed a dish towel and started wiping down the counter. "Only ten times a day since fifth grade," she joked. </p><p> "If I didn't have five thousand relatives watching me all the time," Liz said, "maybe I could have some fun once in a while." </p><p> She sighed, imagining a life where she didn't have to worry about doing something -- anything -- that would make her large, loving extended family worry about her future. She was the first daughter in her family headed for college, and her family wanted to make sure that she stayed on track. And not turn out like her sister, Rosa. </p><p> Liz pulled a handful of change out of her pocket and dumped it on the counter. </p><p> "Wow," Maria said. "Great tips. Maybe I should get my own picture of a baby doll someone left out in the sun too long." Maria scrunched up her nose. "Though I don't know if I could do that whole 'you'd be dead by the end of the week' thing without cracking up." </p><p> "Just practice in front of the mirror. That's what I did," Liz told her. </p><p> "It would take a lot of practice," Maria complained. "Everyone always knows when I'm lying. My ten-year-old brother is a better liar than <i>me.</i> The guys my mom goes out with never believe me when I say how nice it is to meet them." </p><p> Liz snorted. "Big surprise." She popped open the cash register and traded her change for bills. Thirty-three more dollars for the Hasta la Vista Fund. Thirty-three seventy-three, actually. </p><p> The opening notes of the <i>Close Encounters</i> theme played as the cafe door swung open. Max Evans, tall and blond, with killer baby blues, and Michael Guerin, dark and intense, ambled over to the corner booth in the back. Both were students at Liz and Maria's high school. </p><p> "Of course they sit in <i>your</i> section," Maria grumbled. </p><p> Liz and Maria each covered six of the cafe's flying-saucer-shaped booths. They divided the dining room in half from front to back so they each got a couple of booths by the windows. Those were the most popular. </p><p> "You get the tourists and the cute guys, and I get those two," Maria continued. She jerked her chin toward the booth nearest the door. "They're having some big fight. They just scowl at me every time I get near them." </p><p> Liz glanced at the two men in the booth. One was big and beefy. The other was smaller but muscular. They were leaning across the table toward each other, talking intently. She couldn't hear what they were saying, but they both looked furious. </p><p> "I think you deserve a good table after dealing with those guys. You can take Max and Michael," Liz volunteered. </p><p> Maria narrowed her blue eyes. "Okay, what's going on?" </p><p> Liz wrapped her arm around Maria's shoulders. "You're my best friend. Can't I just do something nice for you out of the goodness of my heart?" </p><p> "Nope." Maria shrugged Liz's arm away. I repeat -- what's going on?" </p><p> "Nothing," Liz insisted. "I just feel like taking a little vacation from all the testosterone junkies." </p><p> Maria raised one eyebrow. "Translation, please." </p><p> "Guys," Liz explained. "I'm so tired of their...guyness." </p><p> "All guys aren't like Kyle Valenti, you know," Maria told her. "Take Alex. He's totally cool." </p><p> Alex Manes <i>was</i> totally cool. Liz could hardly believe she and Maria had only been friends with him for a year. She felt as if she'd known him forever. </p><p> "You're right. Alex is the best. But he doesn't count." </p><p> Maria frowned. "Why not?" </p><p> "'Cause he's <i>Alex,</i>" Liz said with a shrug. "He's not a guy guy. Not like Kyle. You should have seen Kyle after school today. He will not accept the fact that I won't go out with him again. He actually got down on his knees and followed me down the hall with his tongue hanging out, begging. All his friends were watching, laughing like the idiots they are." </p><p> It made Liz wish she knew karate. She could have really given his friends something to laugh about. </p><p> "How romantic. And that classy move didn't convince you to go out with him again?" Maria's voice rose in fake shock. </p><p> "Uh -- that would be <i>no.</i> And I'm not going out with anyone else for a while, either," Liz declared. "I'm going to stay home, rent chick flicks, take bubble baths, and wear comfy old sweatpants." </p><p> Liz was looking forward to it. To be fair, most guys she'd been out with -- not that there had been that many -- weren't losers like Kyle Valenti. Kyle actually had thought Liz would <i>enjoy</i> sitting next to him on the couch watching him play Nintendo. He hadn't even offered her a turn! </p><p> But even with the other guys, there had just been that "sameness" about them. </p><p> "My love life is pathetic," Liz mumbled. "I just need some time to myself, for myself." </p><p> "Well, I can mix you up some great herbal bath oils," Maria offered. "But if you stop dating, there are going to be some very unhappy boys at Ulysses F. Olsen High." </p><p> "Like who?" Liz demanded. </p><p> Maria glanced over at the booth, where Max and Michael were sitting. "Max Evans," she said. </p><p> "Max?" Liz repeated. "Max is my buddy. He's not interested in me like that." </p><p> "Oh, please," Maria shot back. "How could he not be interested? You look like some kind of Spanish princess or something with your long black hair and your amazing cheekbones. And let's not talk about your skin. Do you even know the word <i>zit?</i> Plus you're smart and --" </p><p> Liz held up both hands. "Stop!" </p><p> Maria was the most loyal person Liz knew. If you were her friend, she stuck by you no matter what. And Liz and Maria had been friends since the second grade, when they bonded over a hurt baby bird. </p><p> "Okay, I'll stop," Maria answered. "But believe me, Max Evans is more than interested. He probably has the words <i>Property of Liz Ortecho</i> tattooed on his chest. Max --" </p><p> "Hi, Michael!" Liz said loudly as Michael walked up to the counter. She hoped he hadn't heard any of their conversation. </p><p> "Hey." Michael raked his fingers through his jet black hair, making the top even more spiky. "I was wondering if you had a job application I could fill out." </p><p> It was hard for Liz to picture Michael working in the cafe, busing tables and making change and stuff. It seemed too normal, too ordinary for Michael. He should have a job as a Navy SEAL or something like that. Michael was always joking around, but there was a definite edge to him. </p><p> Liz reached under the counter and pulled out a pad of forms. "We don't have any openings right now. But I'll talk to my father, and as soon as something comes up I'll have him call you." </p><p> "Oh, I think you're going to be having some openings real fast," Michael answered in a serious tone. "Unless your dad likes waitresses who stand around gossiping instead of waiting on tables." He winked. </p><p> Maria threw her dish towel at him. Michael cracked up. </p><p> "I'll go," Maria said. She picked up two menus and followed Michael over to his booth. </p><p> Liz shot a quick glance over at Max -- and found herself staring directly into his bright blue eyes. They were such an unusual shade, strange and beautiful. Not the blue of the sky or of the ocean. </p><p> Max held Liz's gaze for a second, then he looked away. </p><p> Maria wasn't right about Max -- was she? Liz had known Max since third grade. He had been her lab partner since they were sophomores. But they never hung out outside of class. And Liz hadn't picked up on any vibe signaling that Max wanted to be more than friends. </p><p> Liz grabbed the nearest napkin holder and restocked it. What would it be like to go out with Max? He wasn't really her type. He was quiet. And kind of a loner. </p><p> He saw the world in a different way from most people. He said things that made Liz stop and think. Like when those scientists in Scotland cloned that sheep. A lot of people talked about who they would clone if they could -- scientists or athletes or movie stars. But Max was more interested in whether or not the soul could be cloned -- and if it couldn't, what that meant. Spending time with Max definitely wasn't boring. </p><p> Liz wiped a drop of milk off the counter. She moved the ketchup bottle up a fraction of an inch so it was exactly even with the mustard bottle. Then she stole another peek at Max. </p><p> No one could say the boy was homely, that was for sure. If there were a beefcake calendar of Ulysses F. Olsen High hotties, Max would be in it. Tall, blond, buff, with those blue, blue eyes... </p><p> Liz felt her face get hot. It was weird thinking of Max that way. Most of the time she forgot he was certifiably gorgeous. Max was just <i>Max.</i> She couldn't -- </p><p> "I don't want the money tomorrow. I want it now!" </p><p> The angry voice interrupted Lizs thoughts. She jerked her head up and saw everyone in the cafe staring at the men in the booth by the door. The beefy man clenched and unclenched his fists as he glared at the muscular man. </p><p> I'd better go get Papa out of the office, she thought. Their argument looks like it's about to get ugly. </p><p> Liz turned toward the door marked Employees Only. </p><p> "He's got a gun!" Maria screeched. </p><p> Liz spun back toward the dining room. Her heart slammed against her ribs. No. Oh no. That's all she could think. Over and over. </p><p> The muscular man held a gun to the beefy man's head. "You won't need any money if you're dead," he said. His voice was calm. Calm and cold. </p><p> Click. </p><p> The muscular man cocked the gun. </p><p> Liz wanted to run, she wanted to scream for help, but she was paralyzed. Her mouth refused to open. Her legs refused to move. </p><p> The beefy man gave a howl of fury. He launched himself across the table at the muscular man. </p><p> An eardrum-shattering explosion rocked the room. </p><p> Liz flew off her feet. She hit the wall behind her, then slumped to the ground. </p><p> She felt something warm and wet gushing across her stomach, soaking into her uniform. </p><p> "There's so much blood," Liz heard Maria cry. </p><p> But she sounded so far away. </p><p> So far... </p><p> <br> Max sprang up from his seat in the booth. Instantly Michael grabbed him by the arm and jerked him back into his seat. </p><p> "Let go of me," Max cried. "Liz could be dying. What are you doing?" </p><p> "No, what are <i>you</i> doing?" Michael tightened his grip on Max's arm. "Are you planning to heal her in the middle of a restaurant? Why not just send the government an invitation -- hi, I'm here, why don't you come on over and get me?" </p><p> Michael was right. Healing Liz would attract attention -- a lot of attention. But if he let Liz die when he knew he could save her... </p><p> That was just not an option. </p><p> "I'm willing to risk it," he told Michael. </p><p> "<i>You're</i> willing to risk it. But what about me? What about Isabel?" Michael demanded. </p><p> Max stared down at the table. He didn't answer. He couldn't answer. He would risk his own life for Liz. But how could he risk the lives of his sister and his best friend? </p><p> "If the government has proof that one of us exists, they'll know there are more. They won't stop searching until they find us -- <i>all</i> of us," Michael continued. </p><p> "I can't stop the bleeding!" Maria screamed from behind the counter. </p><p> Max's heart slammed against his ribs. Liz was dying! He bolted to his feet. "I'll think of something. I promise," he said in a rush. </p><p> Before Michael could stop him, Max raced to the counter and vaulted over it. Pain filled his heart as he stared down at Liz. He swallowed hard. </p><p> Maria held a thick towel over Liz's stomach. But nothing could stop the blood pouring from the gunshot wound. </p><p> Max heard Liz's father on the kitchen phone, giving the cafe's address to the ambulance. They're going to be too late, Max thought. He knew it. He could see it. </p><p> The halo of color surrounding Liz was usually a warm, rich amber that made Max wish he could wrap himself up in it. But now her aura had turned a dull, muddy brown. And it was growing darker by the second. </p><p> Darker and darker as her life force drained out of her. </p><p> Every person's aura was different, as unique as a fingerprint. But the only time anyone's aura turned black was at the moment of death. </p><p> Max...</p></p><h2>Calling a Wolf a Wolf</h2><p><p><b>A POETRY BOOK SOCIETY RECOMMENDATION</b><br><b>SHORTLISTED FOR THE FELIX DENNIS PRIZE FOR BEST FIRST COLLECTION 2018</b></p><p><i>I could not be held responsible</i><br><i>for desire</i><br><i>he could not be held at all</i></p><p>Tracking the joys and pains of the path through addiction, and wrestling with desire, inheritance and faith, <i>Calling a Wolf a Wolf</i> is the darkly sumptuous debut from award-winning poet Kaveh Akbar.

His poems appear recently or soon in <i>The New Yorker, Poetry, APR, Tin House, PBS NewsHour</i>, and elsewhere. He is the author of <i>Calling a Wolf a Wolf</i> (Alice James 2017) and the chapbook <i>Portrait of the Alcoholic</i> (Sibling Rivalry). The recipient of a 2016 Ruth Lilly and Dorothy Sargent Rosenberg Fellowship from the Poetry Foundation and the Lucille Medwick Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, Kaveh was born in Tehran, Iran, and currently lives and teaches in Florida.Advance Praise for Calling a Wolf a Wolf<br>&#x201c;In &#x2018;Heritage,&#x2019; a fierce poem dedicated to an Iranian woman executed for killing the man attempting to rape her, award-winning poet Akbar proclaims, 'in books love can be war-ending/...in life we hold love up to the light/ to marvel at its impotence.' Yet if real-life love is disappointing ('The things I&#x2019;ve thought I've loved/ could sink an ocean liner'), Akbar proves what books can do in his exceptional debut, which brings us along on his struggle with addiction, a dangerous comfort and soul-eating monster he addresses boldly ('thinking if I called a wolf a wolf I might dull its fangs'). His work stands out among literature on the subject for a refreshingly unshowy honesty; Akbar runs full tilt emotionally but is never self-indulgent. These poems find the speaker poised between life&#x2019;s clatter and rattle, wanting to retreat (&#x2018;so much/ of being alive is breaking&#x2019;) yet hungering for more (&#x2018;I'm told what seems like joy/ is often joy'). Indeed, despite his acknowledged disillusion and his failings (&#x2018;my whole life I answered every cry for help with a pour'), he has loved, and an electric current runs through the collection that keeps reader and writer going.

In the end, nothing brings man&#x2015;human or man&#x2015;down to Earth more than the kingdom of flora and fauna.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x2015;Porochista Khakpour, Virginia Quarterly Review<br>"Kaveh Akbar has evolved a poetics that (often) suggests the infinite within each object, gesture, event. The smallest thing in these poems pushes one up against something intractable and profound. Surface and depth constantly turn into each other. Narrative, the dilemmas of personal history and anguish are handled with equal sophistication. 'Odd, for an apocalypse to announce itself with such bounty.' This is bounty, an intensely inventive and original debut.&#x201d; &#x2015;Frank Bidart, author of Metaphysical Dog and Watching the Spring Festival<br>&#x201c;In Calling a Wolf a Wolf, Kaveh Akbar exquisitely and tenaciously braids astonishment and atonement into a singular lyric voice. The desolation of alcoholism widens into hard-won insight: &#x2018;the body is a mosque borrowed from Heaven.&#x2019; Doubt and fear spiral into grace and beauty. Akbar&#x2019;s mind, like his language, is perpetually in motion. His imagery&#x2015;wounded and resplendent&#x2015;is masterful and his syntax ensnares and releases music that&#x2019;s both delicate and muscular.

The work here means to go out on limbs, be it to fling blossoms, chew fireflies, or to push old nests into the river once the rearing is done.

With so many choices of expensive rods, reels, lines, leaders and flies, it's difficult to know where to begin. And it doesn't help that a few of the so-called "experts" in the field write articles implying the sport is difficult to master. The truth is, to be a successful fly angler you don't need to know everything about everything. That's what sets this book apart from the many other fly fishing books available today. In these pages, veteran fly-fishing instructor Chris Hansen concentrates on teaching you the basics. For example, if you aren't sure what level fly angler you are, check out Hansen's "10 Ways to Tell If You're a Beginner." Want to learn how to fly cast? Read "12 Tips to Making the Perfect Cast." And if you think you must carry everything but the kitchen sink with you every time you wade into a stream, look at Hansen's "8 Accessories for Every Trip."<p>Hansen understands the best reason to try fly fishing is that in many situations you can catch more fish with flies than you can with spinning or baitcasting lures. In this book's final chapter, "Catching Fish on Flies," he details these situations for panfish, trout, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and even northern pike. In addition, he shows you his "Top 10 Fly Patterns" for each species and the best retrieves for getting finicky fish to strike.</p></p><p>Chris Hansen is the manager of The Fly Angler, a retail fly-fishing store in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Chris has extensive experience teaching beginners how to fly fish. He organizes and conducts fly-casting and fly-tying classes for customers of his store, and he spends many days each spring, summer and fall guiding novice fly anglers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Chris spent one summer guiding at one of Alaska&#39;s premier fly camps, Tikchik Narrows Lodge. Each winter, he travels to the Texas coast to fly fish for various inshore saltwater species, and he recently returned from a successful fly-fishing adventure to Belize.</p><h2>Look for the Dog : Illustrated Guide to Victor Talking Machines</h2><p>Great reference.</p><p></p><h2>Whose Hands Are These?</h2><p>The book is the story of the life of the renowned healer, Gene Egidio.

How do addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division actually work? What are geometry and logic? As he delves into these subjects, he discovers and lucidly describes the beauty and complexity behind their seemingly simple exteriors, making clear how and why these mercurial, often slippery concepts are essential to who we are.<br>&nbsp;<br>Filled with illuminating historical anecdotes and asides on some of the most fascinating mathematicians through the ages, <i>One, Two, Three</i> is a captivating exploration of the foundation of mathematics: how it originated, who thought of it, and why it matters.</p></p><p><strong>Leonard Mlodinow Reviews <em>One, Two, Three</em></strong> <p><b>Leonard Mlodinow is a physicist at Caltech and the bestselling author of <em>The Drunkard&#x2019;s Walk: How Randomness Rules our Lives</em> and <em>Euclid&#x2019;s Window: The Story of Geometry from Parallel Lines to Hyperspace</em>. He also wrote for <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>. He lives in South Pasadena, California. Read his review of <em>One, Two, Three</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Fifteen years ago, if publishers were sure of anything, it was that (1) calculus is not funny, and (1+1) no one wants to go to lie in bed clutching a book about the concept and history of integral and differential operators. Then along came the always audacious David Berlinski (his bio described him as &#x201c;having a tendency to lose academic positions with what he himself describes as an embarrassing urgency&#x201d;). A mathematician who is by trade a purveyor of proofs, Berlinski wrote <em>A Tour of the Calculus</em>, proving the skeptics wrong on both counts. With <i>One, Two, Three: Absolutely Elementary Mathematics</i>, Berlinski has now applied his vast knowledge, wit, and inimitable trademark writing style to tackle another subject about as sexy as American cheese: arithmetic. But don&#x2019;t worry, you won&#x2019;t find any multiplication tables here--this is a book about what it means to multiply (and add, subtract, and divide). Berlinski challenges us to see these as deeper issues, a level of mathematical thinking that most people never consider, but which forms the very logical foundation upon which rest ideas as vital as one plus one equals two.</p> <p>Is there more to arithmetic than its application through our rote rules of calculation? Berlinski describes how, beginning in the late nineteenth century, mathematicians got around to questioning the meaning of arithmetic, and searching for axioms upon which that structure might be placed. Then he guides us through their reasoning.</p> <p>Numbers form the foundation of our universe, yet most of us never puzzle over what they mean. We take for granted our numbers, the operations we perform on them, and the rules, such as commutivity, that those operations follow. It all seems to work when we buy our cappuccino and croissant, so why question it, unless you get shortchanged? The truth is, we don&#x2019;t question arithmetic because we are in that famous and unenviable position of not knowing the extent of what we do not know. But Berlinski educates us, and shows that the logical basis of arithmetic is worth knowing, and worth appreciating, for it is both beautiful and profound, and represents a grand feat of human imagination. It is the revelation of a world of ideas upon which the simplest counting and calculating--acts without which no planning or transactions, from engineering to commerce, could exist--is predicated. That is David Berlinski&#x2019;s gift to the reader. It is candy for the intellectually curious.</p> <p>(photo: Marcio Fernandes)</p><b>David Berlinski</b> received a B.A. from Columbia University and a Ph.D. from Princeton University.

Modernizers had an audacious, expensive plan to turn the city from a brawling, unglamorous place into "the Metropolis of the World." But just as the dream seemed within reach, pandemonium broke loose--the city's highest ambitions suddenly under attack by the same unbridled energies that had given birth to them in the first place. <br><br>It began on a balmy Monday afternoon when a blimp in flames crashed through the roof of a busy downtown bank, incinerating those inside. Within days,a racial incident at a hot, crowded South Side beach spiraled into one of the worst urban riots in American history, followed by a transit strike that paralyzed the city. Then, when it seemed as if things could get no worse, police searching for a six-year-old girl discovered her body in a dark, North Side basement. <br><br>Meticulously researched yet expertly paced, City of Scoundrels captures the tumultuous birth of the modern American city, with all of its light and dark aspects in vivid relief.</p><p>Gary Krist has written for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Salon</i>, the <i>Washington Post Book World</i>, and other publications.&nbsp; He is the author of the acclaimed <i>The White Cascade</i> as well as several works of fiction.A <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>Daily Beast</i> Hot Read<br><br><i>"City of Scoundrels is a lavishly intricate, well-paced account of a great city lashed to the breaking point by a political perfect storm." - James McManus, New York Times Book Review</i><br><i></i><i><em></em></i><em> </em><br><br>"<i>History that feels like the most compelling adventure yarn, full of crashing dirigibles, bloody riots and classic crooks.

They are intended as much for the person who glances at the financial pages in the evening to see how his or her investments are faring as for the full-time trader or professional money manager. Their underlying message is that you are in a contest with yourself and not the market. Just as the lack of sense of self makes the samurai warrior a powerful and formidable opponent, it can make you successful in your stock trading. You will lose less. You will make greater profits. It is simple.<br>This book presents a Zen approach that reveals how to listen, recognize, and obey the language that every market speaks. It is very easy to understand. It may, however, be very hard for you to do. Your ego may be very reluctant to be subdued. Practice will make it happen. Practice will make you money.<br>Edward Allen Toppel gives you the basic rules of successful trading with Zen. He teaches you what he calls "inner game trading techniques." He even shows you haiku for traders. Like the classic Zen in the Art of Archery, this small book contains life-changing ideas. Illuminating, exciting, and challenging, it can keep you on the right side of the balance sheet: a samurai in the markets.</p><p></p><h2>StatClass, Second Edition, Revised Printing</h2><p>A math book on Statistics (introductory), and is known to be used at UCSB for PSTAT 5A</p><p></p><h2>Before It&#39;s Too Late</h2><p>This is a body of work which gives concerned parents and professionals instructive insight into the personality of &#34;problem children&#34; and gives practical suggestions for taking corrective and remedial steps before it&#39;s too late.</p><p>dy of work which gives concerned parents and professionals instructive insight into the personality of &#34;problem children&#34; and gives practical suggestions for taking corrective and remedial steps before it&#39;s too late.&#x201c;Wise, tough, and full of common sense.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Washington Post</i><br></p><h2>The Treasure Hunter's Gem &amp; Mineral Guides to the U.S.A.: Where &amp; How to Dig, Pan, and Mine Your Own Gems &amp; Minerals : Southeast States</h2><p><p><b>Learn Where &amp; How to Dig, Pan and Mine <i>Your Own </i> Gems &amp; Minerals </b></p> <p><b> NORTHEAST </b></p> <p><b> Connecticut ?

The popular Indian spiritual teacher/author, who died in 1986, believed global peace might ensue if children were reared without prejudices, nationalisms, competitiveness--even without organized religious faiths. Hoping to awaken people to the dangerous state of the world, he saw complete self-transformation as a precondition for social or political change. In this insightful biographical study, Lutyens ( Krishnamurti: The Years of Awakening ) provides a detailed account of the guru's mystical experiences, his break with theosophy and his associations with David Bohm and Jacob Needleman. In charting Krishnamurti's metamorphosis from bewildered, "vacant, childish" youth to mature thinker, she illuminates the sources in his personal life from which his philosophy flowed.

It forms an introduction to his life and work for new generations of spiritual seekers. Krishnamurti's works--lectures that fill many volumes--can seem even more austere and inaccessible than Zen.

Though dispatched as peacekeepers, the American units (whose ranks encompass several characters, including Captain Nancy Kozak, from the author's earlier works) soon find themselves engaged in deadly battles against aggressive, well-equipped guerrillas. The ambiguous mission of the muddy-boots soldiers is not made any easier by their divisional commander, Major General G.B. Lane, a rear-echelon martinet who disregards field intelligence when it suits his careerist purposes. Disturbed by what's shaping up as a Vietnam-like quagmire, the Army's Chief of Staff assigns straightshooting Scott Dixon, a newly minted brigadier, to be his eyes and ears in the war-torn republic. Also on the scene is Jan Fields, Dixon's loyal wife and, by providential happenstance, chief of World News Network's Bogota bureau. The plucky WNN correspondent's enterprising inquiries into an abortive air assault operation that Lane has covered up help precipitate outcomes ranging from her own expulsion through relief of the pusillanimous Lane, who has vindictively threatened to court-martial Kozak despite the bravery and effective leadership she has shown under fire. Dixon (who has saved Washington's bacon in previous Coyle thrillers) eventually takes charge of the expeditional force, which has to fight its way out of Colombia as insurgents topple the incumbent regime. Back in the Pentagon, the old soldier ruefully counts the high cost of geopolitical adventurism for those at the sharp end of the bayonet. Authentic accounts of high-tech combat action on alien fields in the context of an all too plausible foreign-relations/military snafu, plus credible portrayals of women at arms. Another winner for Coyle and his ongoing cast of heroines as well as heroes. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

True arbiters of taste define ultimate opulence by what hovers above and beyond the address: past the uniformed doorman, up the elevator, and across quiet thresholds. Here lies a world only a very privileged few call home �&#x2014; the coveted suites created by Rosario Candela and James Carpenter, time-honored masters of 20th century apartment house design. <br><br>Originally published in 2002, THE NEW YORK APARTMENT HOUSES OF ROSARIO CANDELA AND JAMES CARPENTER remains the only major work on two of the most significant figures in the history of apartment house architecture. Richly illustrated with archival photographs and floor plans, the book provides the architectural and social history of the great buildings of Candela and Carpenter, demonstrating the breadth of the designers' contribution to Manhattan's exterior and interior landscape. Added to the vintage photographs of elevations and interiors are later interiors done by some of New York�&#x2019;s design elite: Buatta, Couturier, Cullman, Ferguson Shamamian &amp; Rattner, Gwathmey, McMillen, Mark Hampton, Molyneux, Parish-Hadley, and others. <br><br>"Rosario Candela has replaced Stanford White as the real estate brokers' name-drop of choice," writes New York Times "Streetscapes" columnist, Christopher Gray. "Nowadays, to own a 10- to 20-room apartment in a Candela-designed building is to accede to architectural, as well as social cynosure." <br> <br>"There was a wonderful assurance and solidity to his [Candela's] buildings," writes architecture critic Paul Goldberger. "They don't display any visible effort, in the greatest traditions of old money."</p><p>Andrew Alpern is an architectural historian, an architect, and an attorney.

For Duncan and Jess, the household&#x2015;rather than the studio, gallery, or collective&#x2015;provided the support structure for their art. Indeed, McDowell argues convincingly, their work was coextensive with their household. The material surroundings of their house in San Francisco and the daily rhythms of their domestic lives became part of their creative practice. </p><p>Duncan wrote poetry that is romantic, ornate, and obscure; Jess (born Burgess Franklin Collins) created multi-imaged, complex collages and assemblages. McDowell explores their life and work&#x2015;reading Duncan and Jess with and against each other, in alignment and misalignment. She examines their illustrated book <i>Caesar's Gate</i>, a collaborative effort that led them to reject collaboration; considers each man's lifelong preoccupation with an unfinished project, Jess's <i>Narkissos</i> and Duncan's <i>The H.D. Book</i>; and discusses their &#x201c;origin myths&#x201d; and self-made genealogies, describing them as a form of witness in the face of the calamities of the twentieth century. </p><p>Duncan and Jess made the household a necessary precondition for their art making. Doing so, they reclaimed and rehabilitated the domestic&#x2015;from which gay couples were traditionally excluded&#x2015;for their own uses. The household permitted them to reimagine the world. McDowell's portrait of a couple expands to encompass broader issues, urgent in midcentury America and still resonant today: belonging and kinship, alienation, and catastrophe.</p></p><p>Tara McDowell is Associate Professor and Director of Curatorial Practice at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. She has worked as a curator at the CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art.<p>&#x201c;<i>The Householders</i>&nbsp;casts a superbly illuminating light on the singular domestic life shared by Robert Duncan and Jess, that&nbsp;mus�e imaginaire&nbsp;so generative of their artistic accomplishments.

Orth, a special correspondent for <i>Vanity Fair</i> and an award-winning investigative journalist, had just filed a story on the homicidal young poseur when Versace's murder grabbed headlines across the nation. As the media scrambled to make the connection between high-profile victim and shadowy assailant, it was Orth who broke the news that Cunanan claimed to have known the fashion superstar--perhaps more intimately than Versace's handlers were comfortable admitting publicly.<p> <i>Vulgar Favors</i>, Orth's first book, is the story of a monster obsessed with social climbing. From his earliest childhood, Cunanan's severely dysfunctional parents programmed him with a sense of entitlement but gave him no means of entr�e into the glittering world of wealth and privilege he so desperately desired. At first, Cunanan's youthful, exotic good looks and magpie intelligence earned him access to the upper echelons of San Diego's fabulously decadent and closeted gay rich, but as drugs and dissolution exacted their toll, the doors closed tight and Cunanan's rage and frustration took a murderous bent. The most interesting parts of Orth's tale, however, are not the lurid details of depravity but the revelations on how Versace's celebrity status influenced the investigation into his murder. Even in death, it would appear, the rich are very different from you and me. <i>--Patrizia DiLucchio</i></p>Two months before Andrew Cunanan murdered Gianni Versace on the steps of his Miami Beach mansion, Maureen Orth was investigating a major story on the serial killer for Vanity Fair. Now the award-winning journalist and Vanity Fair special correspondent tells the complete story of Cunanan, his unwitting victims, and the moneyed, hedonistic world in which they lived and died, culled from interviews with over 400 people, and details from thousands of pages of police reports.<p>In chilling detail, Maureen Orth reveals how Andrew Cunanan met his superstar victim...why police and the FBI repeatedly failed to catch Cunanan...why other victims' families stonewalled the investigation...controversial findings of the Versace autopsy report, and more. Here is a late-century odyssey that races across America from California's wealthy gay underworld to modest midwestern homes of families mourning their slaughtered sons to the celebration of decadence that is Versace's South Beach. It is at once a landmark work of investigative journalism and a riveting account of a sociopath, his savage crimes, and the mysteries he left along the way.</p></p><h2>Maigret in Vichy</h2><p>Paris has taken its toll and Maigret is sent to Vichy for the cure, but the Inspector finds it difficult to give his curiosity a rest.

All cops are. But he knew he was more than that: he liked to get involved in the lives around him. He had a need to know which went beyond voyeurism. It was a drug. And the thing was, when he had all this knowledge, he then had to use booze to blank it out..." In his ninth outing, Edinburgh's glowering and tenacious Inspector John Rebus finds a unique way of cutting back on alcohol. Convinced that Rebus might lie or try to destroy evidence in the reopened case of a man convicted of a murder he probably didn't commit, the investigating officer assigns him a babysitter. Luckily, the minder is one of Rebus's old mentors, Jack Morton, a former drinking buddy now waging a successful battle against the bottle. Rebus and Morton burn off energy and anger repainting Rebus's apartment, while trying to clear Rebus's name and exploring the connection between a recent string of murders and a real-life Scottish serial killer of the 1970s known as Bible John. The cases take Rebus to Aberdeen and an oil platform in the North Atlantic, but as usual the main action happens within the mind and soul of Rankin's meticulously crafted creation. Previous entries in the memorable Rebus series are also available, including <i>Let It Bleed</i>, <i>Hide and Seek</i>, <i>Knots and Crosses</i>, <i>Mortal Causes</i>, and <i>Tooth and Nail</i>.Ian Rankin has written fourteen previous novels, and has also worked as a grape-picker, swineherd, taxman, alcohol researcher, music journalist, and punk rock musician.

The victim is the vicar's wife. The setting is a prototypical English town during a fair. The detective, Inspector Ramsay, is an unmarried and singularly brainy member of the constabulary ably assisted by a loyal sergeant who desperately desires action, not theories. Ramsay is as mundane and conventional as the trappings, as he tries to understand the victim while tracing her last hours of life. Meanwhile a succession of suspects is paraded for the reader's inspection, including the victim's stepson, his insecure girlfriend, a half-witted young man half in love with the victim, a dying widow, a social worker and an alcoholic ne'er-do-well. Unfortunately, none of them grabs our attention or loyalty, even after the half-wit is the victim of the inevitable second murder. The pace slowly picks up after that, and the concluding 20 or so pages are suspenseful and fast-paced, but they seem slim reward for readers who must slog through the first 190 pages of cliched two-dimensionality to get there. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Asian Noodles: Deliciously Simple Dishes To Twirl, Slurp, And Savor</h2><p>One of the most popular authorities on Asian cuisine demonstrates a wide range of satisfying and delicious noodle dishes that can be made at home, featuring seventy-five recipes for noodle soups, salads, starters, sides, and complete suppers.</p><p>Udon, ramen, pho, pad thai -- there&#39;s a seemingly endless array of Asian noodle dishes that have found a very comfortable niche in Western foodie culture.

Since then he has been recognized as one of the most influential cult horror writers of this century. His influence on American horror has extended to Stephen King, Anne Rice, Clive Barker, and many others.Cool Air<br><br>You ask me to explain why I am afraid of a draught of cool air; why I shiver more than others upon entering a cold room, and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day. There are those who say I respond to cold as others do to a bad odour, and I am the last to deny the impression. What I will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance I ever encountered, and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarity.<br><br>It is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness, silence, and solitude. I found it in the glare of midafternoon, in the clangour of a metropolis, and in the teaming midst of a shabby and commonplace rooming-house with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side. In the spring of 1923 I had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of New York; and being unable to pay any substantial rent, began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness, endurable furnishings, and very reasonable price. It soon developed that I had only a choice between different evils, but after a time I came upon a house in West Fourteenth Street which disgusted me much less than the others I had sampled.<br><br>The place was a four-story mansion of brownstone, dating apparently from the late forties, and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence. In the rooms, large and lofty, and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices, there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery; but the floors were clean, the linen tolerably regular, and the hot water not too often cold or turned off, so that I came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again. The landlady, a slatternly, almost bearded Spanish woman named Herrero, did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the late-burning electric light in my third-floor front hall room; and my fellow-lodgers were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire, being mostly Spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade. Only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance.<br><br>I had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred. One evening at about eight I heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that I had been smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time. Looking about, I saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street. Anxious to stop the matter at its source, I hastened to the basement to tell the landlady; and was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set right.<br><br>"Doctair Mu�oz," she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me, "he have speel hees chemicals. He ees too seeck for doctair heemself-seecker and seecker all the time-but he weel not have no othair for help. He ees vairy queer in hees seeckness-all day he take funnee-smelling baths, and he cannot get excite or warm. All hees own housework he do-hees leetle room are full of bottles and machines, and he do not work as doctair. But he was great once-my fathair in Barcelona have hear of heem-and only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get hurt of sudden. He nevair go out, only on roof, and my boy Esteban he breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals. My Gawd, the sal-ammoniac that man use for keep heem cool!"<br><br>Mrs. Herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor, and I returned to my room. The ammonia ceased to drip, and as I cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air, I heard the landlady's heavy footsteps above me. Dr. Mu�oz I had never heard, save for certain sounds as of some gasoline-driven mechanism; since his step was soft and gentle. I wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be, and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity. There is, I reflected tritely, an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who has come down in the world.<br><br>I might never have known Dr. Mu�oz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as I sat writing in my room. Physicians had told me of the danger of those spells, and I knew there was no time to be lost; so remembering what the landlady had said about the invalid's help of the injured workman, I dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine. My knock was answered in good English by a curious voice some distance to the right, asking my name and business; and these things being stated, there came an opening of the door next to the one I had sought.<br><br>A rush of cool air greeted me; and though the day was one of the hottest of late June, I shivered as I crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness. A folding couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa, and the mahogany furniture, sumptuous hangings, old paintings, and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman's study rather than a boarding-house bedroom. I now saw that the hall room above mine-the "leetle room" of bottles and machines which Mrs. Herrero had mentioned-was merely the laboratory of the doctor; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusively utilitarian devices. Dr. Mu�oz, most certainly, was a man of birth, cultivation, and discrimination.<br><br>The figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned, and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit. A high-bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron-grey full beard, and an old- fashioned pince-nez shielded the full, dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a Moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly Celtiberian. Thick, well-trimmed hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead; and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding.<br><br>Nevertheless, as I saw Dr. Mu�oz in that blast of cool air, I felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify. Only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling, and even these things should have been excusable considering the man's known invalidism. It might, too, have been the singular cold that alienated me; for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day, and the abnormal always excites aversion, distrust, and fear.<br><br>But repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration, for the strange physician's extreme skill at once became manifest despite the ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless-looking hands. He clearly understood my needs at a glance, and ministered to them with a master's deftness; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death, and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation. Something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him, and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room. Evidently he found the society of a well-born man a rare novelty in this dingy environment, and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him.<br><br>His voice, if queer, was at least soothing; and I could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out. He sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of his theories and experiments; and I remember his tactfully consoling me about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are stronger than organic life itself, so that if a bodily frame be but originally healthy and carefully preserved, it may through a scientific enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation despite the most serious impairments, defects, or even absences in the battery of specific organs. He might, he half jestingly said, some day teach me to live-or at least to possess some kind of conscious existence-without any heart at all! For his part, he was afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which included constant cold. Any marked rise in temperature might, if prolonged, affect him fatally; and the frigidity of his habitation-some 55 or 56 degrees Fahrenheit-was maintained by an absorption system of ammonia cooling, the gasoline engine of whose pumps I had often heard in my own room below.<br><br>Relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while, I left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse. After that I paid him frequent overcoated calls; listening while he told of secret researches and almost ghastly results, and trembling a bit when I examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves. I was eventually, I may add, almost cured of my disease for all time by his skillful ministrations. It seems that he did not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists, since he believed these cryptic formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic pulsations had fled. I was touched by his account of the aged Dr. Torres of Valencia, who had shared his earlier experiments and nursed him through the great illness of eighteen years before, whence his present disorders proceeded. No sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought. Perhaps the strain had been too great; for Dr. Mu�oz made it whisperingly clear-though not in detail-that the methods of healing had been most extraordinary, involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative Galens.<br><br>As the weeks passed, I observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically, as Mrs. Herrero had suggested. The livid aspect of his countenance was intensified, his voice became more hollow and indistinct, his muscular motions were less perfectly coordinated, and his mind and will displayed less resilience and initiative. Of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware, and little by little his expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something of the subtle repulsion I had originally felt.<br><br>He developed strange caprices, acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and Egyptian incense till his room smelled like a vault of a sepulchred Pharaoh in the Valley of Kings. At the same time his demands for cold air increased, and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the temperature as low as 34� or 40�, and finally even 28�; the bathroom and laboratory, of course, being less chilled, in order that water might not freeze, and that chemical processes might not be impeded. The tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from around the connecting door, so I helped him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty. A kind of growing horror, of outr� and morbid cast, seemed to possess him. He talked of death incessantly, but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested.<br><br>All in all, he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion; yet in my gratitude for his healing I could not well abandon him to the strangers around him, and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day, muffled in a heavy ulster which I bought especially for the purpose. I likewise did much of his shopping, and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses.<br><br>An increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment. The whole house, as I have said, had a musty odour; but the smell in his room was worse-and in spite of all the spices and incense, and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he insisted on taking unaided. I perceived that it must be connected with his ailment, and shuddered when I reflected on what that ailment might be. Mrs. Herrero crossed herself when she looked at him, and gave him up unreservedly to me; not even letting her son Esteban continue to run errands for him. When I suggested other physicians, the sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain. He evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion, yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned, and he refused to be confined to his bed. The lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return of his fiery purpose, so that he seemed about to hurl defiance at the death-daemon even as that ancient enemy seized him. The pretence of eating, always curiously like a formality with him, he virtually abandoned; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from total collapse.<br><br>He acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort, which he carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that I transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he named-for the most part lettered East Indians, but including a once celebrated French physician now generally thought dead, and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered. As it happened, I burned all these papers undelivered and unopened. His aspect and voice became utterly frightful, and his presence almost unbearable. One September day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight. That man, oddly enough, had been through the terrors of the Great War without having incurred any fright so thorough.<br><br>Then, in the middle of October, the horror of horrors came with stupefying suddenness. One night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down, so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible. Dr. Mu�oz summoned me by thumping on the floor, and I worked desperately to repair the injury while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless, rattling hollowness surpassed description. My amateur efforts, however, proved of no use; and when I had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring all-night garage, we learned that nothing could be done till morning, when a new piston would have to be obtained. The moribund hermit's rage and fear, swelling to grotesque proportions, seemed likely to shatter what remained of his failing physique, and once a spasm caused him to clap his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom. He groped his way out with face tightly bandaged, and I never saw his eyes again.<br><br>The frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing, and at about 5 a.m. the doctor retired to the bathroom, commanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice I could obtain at all-night drug stores and cafeterias. As I would return from my sometimes discouraging trips and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door, I could hear a restless splashing within, and a thick voice croaking out the order for "More-more!" At length a warm day broke, and the shops opened one by one. I asked Esteban either to help with the ice-fetching whilst I obtained the pump piston, or to order the piston while I continued with the ice; but...</p><h2>A Field Guide to Rocky Mountain Wildflowers: Northern Arizona and New Mexico to British Columbia (Peterson Field Guide Series)</h2><p>This guide describes 590 species, with detailed information on flowering season, related species, range, and habitat.

In a simple story told in rhyme, stable animals ask ``Who is coming to our house?'' `` `Someone, someone,' says Mouse.'' With anticipation, each animal helps to prepare ``their house'' for the unnamed guests. By nightfall, the stable is readied and the animals welcome Mary and Joseph. A double-page illustration shows the animals gazing upon the baby Jesus cradled in his Mother's arms. Wolff uses the same linoleum block and wash technique so effective in A Year of Birds (Dodd, 1984) and A Year of Beasts (Dutton, 1986). As in the earlier titles, the unusual perspectives and figures breaking through the black-lined boundaries add to the visual drama. Here, rich earth tones give a sense of the natural humility and love of the stable birth. Preschoolers and some toddlers will easily recognize most of the animals portrayed, but unless children already know the Christmas story they won't appreciate the importance of the human visitors, since Mary and Joseph are identified only by name. This may not be an obvious first choice as a holiday book or an animal identification book, but it is worth consideration for either shelf.

Olga Kharitidi, MD, author of <i>Entering the Circle</i> and <i>The Master of Lucid Dreams</i></p><h2>Luka and the Fire of Life</h2><p><p>Like all children about to set off on an adventure, Luka Khalifa is a special kid. For one thing, his father is the famed storyteller Rashid Khalifa, &#x201c;the Shah of Blah,&#x201d; &#x201c;the Ocean of Notions.&#x201d; For another, Luka&#x2019;s older brother, Haroun, had already had an adventure of his own, travelling to a previously unknown moon and overthrowing a terrible enemy who threatened the Sea of Stories. Finally, and most importantly, Luka&#x2019;s mother announced on the day of his birth that her newborn son had the power to turn back time; after all, he had been born well after his parents&#x2019; youth. Plus, he was left-handed. So it is only a matter of time before Luka finds himself in the midst of a great adventure.<br>&nbsp;<br>It begins, however, with something Luka gives very little thought to. When the Great Rings of Fire circus comes to the city of Kahani, Luka stops to watch the animals and performers troop through the streets. When he sees that the gentle beasts are treated cruelly by the brutish leader of the circus, the hard-hearted Captain Aag, he does what any other kid would do: he curses the circus master. <br>&nbsp;<br>The difference between Luka and other kids, however, is that Luka&#x2019;s curse comes to pass. An evil fate befalls the circus, and the next morning, outside Luka&#x2019;s door are waiting a circus bear named Dog and a circus dog named Bear. They have come to be Luka&#x2019;s companions.<br>&nbsp;<br>But curses are not things to be thrown about lightly, and Luka&#x2019;s first experiments with magic soon come back to haunt him, as a mysterious illness takes hold of his beloved father. Just when it seems that Rashid Khalifa will fade away altogether, Luka is visited by a flock of hideous vultures bearing a message from Captain Aag, threatening vengeance for the boy&#x2019;s curse. <br>&nbsp;<br>The next morning, he looks out into the street and sees an apparition that looks exactly like his father. As he dashes out into the street to try to make sense of this double, he stumbles, and when he regains his balance he realizes he has somehow stepped into the World of Magic.<br>&nbsp;<br>And so begins his adventure.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the company of Bear, the dog, and Dog, the bear, and led by this troubling version of his father, whom he calls Nobodaddy, Luka must do what his mother said he was born to. To save his father, he must work his way upstream, against the current of the River of Time, and do what has never been done: he must steal the Fire of Life. <br>&nbsp;<br>The episodes of his quest are hair-raising and often hilarious. Luka and his companions must make their way past the many dangers of the River of Time as they head upstream. Some, like the Old Man of the River, are there to guard against intruders. Others, like the rats of the Respectorate of I, are merely ill-tempered. And the most perilous dangers aren&#x2019;t enemies at all, but the simple fact that it&#x2019;s difficult to go upstream, and if you do you&#x2019;ll have to pass the Swamp of the Mists of Time and the Whirlpool of El Tiempo, to say nothing of the Rings of Fire. <br>&nbsp;<br>But the World of Magic is not all hostile, and as he works his way towards his goal, Luka makes many friends, receives help from strangers and even falls in love. By the end of his adventure, the whole World of Magic has been stirred up like a hornets&#x2019; nest by the young intruder.<br>&nbsp;<br>Still, the best adventures aren&#x2019;t about swashbuckling or narrow escapes; they&#x2019;re about learning something about the world and about yourself. As Luka is drawn deeper and deeper into this strange world populated by nearly forgotten gods and figures from exotic myth, it is not the World of Magic that comes into focus for him, but his relationship with his beloved father back home in bed, the storyteller who conjured this whole world out of nothing by the sheer force of his imagination.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the end, Luka&#x2019;s adventure is quite literally a race against time. But to succeed, the young boy must not only make his way to the Fire of Life &#x2013; to return, he must convince the angry gods of the truths he has learned on his quest. Only when he has changed the World of Magic can he return to his own world and his father&#x2019;s bedside.<br>&nbsp;<br>Weaving together bits of mythology, fairy tales, children&#x2019;s puns, metaphysics and echoes from well-known tales as different as <b>The Matrix</b> and <b>The Wizard of Oz</b>, <b>Luka and the Fire of Life</b> becomes a story about things as intimate as a boy&#x2019;s love for his family, and as sprawling as the meaning of life itself.</p></p><p><strong>Salman Rushdie on <em>Luka and the Fire of Life</em></strong> <p> </p> <p>There&#x2019;s a line in Paul Simon&#x2019;s song <em>St. Judy&#x2019;s Comet</em>, a sort of lullaby, about his reason for writing it. "If I can&#x2019;t sing my boy to sleep," he sings, "it makes your famous daddy look so dumb." More than twenty years ago, when my older son Zafar said to me that I should write a book he could read, I thought about that line. <em>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</em>, written in 1989-90, a dark time for me, was the result. I tried to fill it with light and even to give it a happy ending. Happy endings were things I had become very interested in at the time.</p> <p>When my younger son Milan read <em>Haroun</em> he immediately began to insist that he, too, merited a book. <em>Luka and the Fire of Life</em> is born of that insistence. It is not exactly a sequel to the earlier book, but it is a companion. The same family is at the heart of both books, and in both books a son must rescue a father. Beyond those similarities, however, the two books inhabit very different imaginative milieux.</p> <p><em>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</em> was born at a time of crisis in its author&#x2019;s life and the fictional Haroun&#x2019;s quest to rescue his father&#x2019;s lost storytelling skills in a world in which stories themselves are being poisoned was a fable that responded to that crisis.</p> <p><em>Luka and the Fire of Life</em> is a response to a different, but equally great, danger: that an older father may not live to see his son grow up. In the earlier book, it was storytelling that was being threatened; in the new one, it is the storyteller who is at risk. Once again, the book grows out of the reality of my own life, and my relationship with a very particular child. Luka is my son Milan&#x2019;s middle name, just as Haroun is Zafar&#x2019;s.</p> <p>As well as the central theme of life and death, <em>Luka</em> explores in, I hope, suitably fabulous and antic fashion, things I have thought about all my life: the relationships between the world of imagination and the "real" world, between authoritarianism and liberty, between what is true and what is phony, and between ourselves and the gods that we create. Younger readers do not need to dwell on these matters. Older readers may, however, find them satisfying.</p> <p>It has been my aim, in <em>Luka</em> as in <em>Haroun</em>, to write a story that demolishes the boundary between "adult" and "children&#x2019;s" literature. One way I have thought about <em>Luka</em> and <em>Haroun</em> is that each of them is a message in a bottle. A child may read these books and, I hope, derive from them the pleasures and satisfactions that children seek from books. The same child may read them again when he or she is grown, and see a different book, with adult satisfactions instead of (or as well as) the earlier ones.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t want to end without thanking the boys for whom these books were written and who helped me in their creation with a number of invaluable editorial suggestions. <em>Luka and the Fire of Life</em> has been the most enjoyable writing experience I&#x2019;ve had since I wrote <em>Haroun and the Sea of Stories</em>. I hope it may prove as enjoyable to read as it was to write.</p> <p>(Photo � Alberto Conti)</p><p>Knighted by Queen Elizabeth, named to the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France and elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Sir Salman Rushdie is one of the foremost novelists of our time. Winner of the Booker Prize, the Best of the Bookers, and the Booker of Bookers, Rushdie ranks with the best writers of a generation.<br>&nbsp;<br>The author of sixteen previous books, Rushdie is best known for his second novel, <b>Midnight&#x2019;s Children</b>, which launched him into fame, and <b>The Satanic Verses</b>, which touched off a storm of protest across the Muslim world and resulted in a fatwa issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran. These two novels together helped shape two themes that have come together to give form to his career. On one hand, he nearly single-handedly defined the shape that Indian novels written in English would take for decades. And on the other he became a symbol of enlightenment and free speech, defiant against the forces of intolerance and fundamentalist religion.<br>&nbsp;<br>His books often tread a path that navigates these directions in his career. Fascinated both by the form of magic realism and the subject matter of post-colonialism, and by the experiences of various diasporas, Rushdie&#x2019;s works have an uncanny ability to tease the story out of people&#x2019;s sacred truths.<br>&nbsp;<br>An international celebrity, Rushdie is often in the public eye, whether the focus is on his personal life or his political views. He is also Distinguished Writer-in-Residence at Emory University, and <b>Midnight&#x2019;s Children</b> has been adapted for a film version, to be shot by Canadian director Deepa Mehta.</p></p><h2>WAY THINGS WORK</h2><p>Scientific principles, inventions, and chemical, mechanical, and industrial processes are explained for the general reader with the help of drawings and diagrams</p><p></p><h2>Woman in Cabin 10</h2><p>This was meant to be the perfect trip. <p>The Northern Lights.

I must have forgotten to shut the kitchen door last night. Punishment for coming home drunk.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go away,&#x201d; I groaned. Delilah mewed and butted me with her head. I tried to bury my face in the pillow but she continued rubbing herself against my ear, and eventually I rolled over and heartlessly pushed her off the bed.<br> <br>She thumped to the floor with an indignant little meep and I pulled the duvet over my head, but even through the covers I could hear her scratching at the bottom of the door, rattling it in its frame.<br> <br>The door was closed.<br> <br>I sat up, my heart suddenly thumping, and Delilah leaped onto my bed with a glad little chirrup, but I snatched her to my chest, stilling her movements, listening.<br> <br>I might well have forgotten to shut the kitchen door, or I could even have knocked it to without closing it properly. But my bedroom door opened outward&#x2014;a quirk of the weird layout of my flat. There was no way Delilah could have shut herself inside. Someone must have closed it.<br> <br>I sat, frozen, holding Delilah&#x2019;s warm, panting body against my chest and trying to listen.<br> <br>Nothing.<br> <br>And then, with a gush of relief, it occurred to me&#x2014;she&#x2019;d probably been hiding under my bed and I&#x2019;d shut her inside with me when I came home. I didn&#x2019;t remember closing my bedroom door, but I might have swung it absently shut behind me when I came in. To be honest, everything from the tube station onwards was a bit of a blur. The headache had started to set in on the journey home, and now that my panic was wearing off, I could feel it starting up again in the base of my skull. I really needed to stop drinking midweek. It had been okay in my twenties, but I just couldn&#x2019;t shake off the hangovers like I used to.<br> <br>Delilah began squirming uneasily in my arms, digging her claws into my forearm, and I let her go while I reached for my dressing gown and belted it around myself. Then I scooped her up, ready to sling her out into the kitchen.<br> <br>But when I opened the bedroom door, there was a man standing there.<br> <br>There&#x2019;s no point in wondering what he looked like, because, believe me, I went over it about twenty-five times with the police. &#x201c;Not even a bit of skin around his wrists?&#x201d; they kept saying. No, no, and no. He had a hoodie on, and a bandanna around his nose and mouth, and everything else was in shadow. Except for his hands.<br> <br>On these he was wearing latex gloves. It was that detail that scared the shit out of me. Those gloves said, &#x201c;I know what I&#x2019;m doing.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve come prepared.&#x201d; They said, &#x201c;I might be after more than your money.&#x201d;<br> <br>We stood there for a long second, facing each other, his shining eyes locked on to mine.<br> <br>About a thousand thoughts raced through my mind: Where the hell is my phone? Why did I drink so much last night? I would have heard him come in if I&#x2019;d been sober. Oh Christ, I wish Judah was here.<br> <br>And most of all&#x2014;those gloves. Oh my God, those gloves. They were so professional. So clinical.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t speak. I didn&#x2019;t move. I just stood there, my ratty dressing gown gaping, and I shook. Delilah wriggled out of my unresisting hands and shot away up the hallway to the kitchen, and I just stood there, shaking.<br> <br>Please, I thought. Please don&#x2019;t hurt me.<br> <br>Oh God, where was my phone?<br> <br>Then I saw something in the man&#x2019;s hands. My handbag&#x2014;my new Burberry handbag, although that detail seemed monumentally unimportant. There was only one thing that mattered about that bag. My mobile was inside.<br> <br>His eyes crinkled in a way that made me think he might be smiling beneath the bandanna, and I felt the blood drain from my head and my fingers, pooling in the core of my body, ready to fight or flee, whichever it had to be.<br> <br>He took a step forwards.<br> <br>&#x201c;No . . .&#x201d; I said. I wanted it to sound like a command, but it came out like a plea&#x2014;my voice small and squeaky and quavering pathetically with fear. &#x201c;N&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>But I didn&#x2019;t even get to finish. He slammed the bedroom door in my face, hitting my cheek.<br> <br>For a long moment I stood, frozen, holding my hand to my face, speechless with the shock and pain. My fingers felt ice-cold, but there was something warm and wet on my face, and it took a moment for me to realize it was blood, that the molding on the door had cut my cheek.<br> <br>I wanted to run back to bed, to shove my head under the pillows and cry and cry. But a small, ugly voice in my skull kept saying, He&#x2019;s still out there. What if he comes back? What if he comes back for you?<br> <br>There was a sound from out in the hall, something falling, and I felt a rush of fear that should have galvanized me but instead paralyzed me. Don&#x2019;t come back. Don&#x2019;t come back. I realized I was holding my breath, and I made myself exhale, long and shuddering, and then slowly, slowly, I forced my hand out towards the door.<br> <br>There was another crash in the hallway outside, breaking glass, and with a rush I grabbed the knob and braced myself, my bare toes dug into the old, gappy floorboards, ready to hold the door closed as long as I could. I crouched there, against the door, hunched over with my knees to my chest, and I tried to muffle my sobs with my dressing gown while I listened to him ransacking the flat and hoped to God that Delilah had run out into the garden, out of harm&#x2019;s way.<br> <br>At last, after a long time, I heard the front door open and shut, and I sat there, crying into my knees and unable to believe he&#x2019;d really gone. That he wasn&#x2019;t coming back to hurt me. My hands felt numb and painfully stiff, but I didn&#x2019;t dare let go of the handle.<br> <br>I saw again those strong hands in the pale latex gloves.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know what would have happened next. Maybe I would have stayed there all night, unable to move. But then I heard Delilah outside, mewing and scratching at the other side of the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Delilah,&#x201d; I said hoarsely. My voice was trembling so much I hardly sounded like myself. &#x201c;Oh, Delilah.&#x201d;<br> <br>Through the door I heard her purr, the familiar, deep, chainsaw rasp, and it was like a spell had been broken.<br> <br>I let my cramped fingers loosen from the doorknob, flexing them painfully, and then stood up, trying to steady my trembling legs, and turned the door handle.<br> <br>It turned. In fact it turned too easily, twisting without resistance under my hand, without moving the latch an inch. He&#x2019;d removed the spindle from the other side.<br> <br>Fuck.<br> <br>Fuck, fuck, fuck.<br> <br>I was trapped.</p><h2>The Administrative Professional: Procedures and Skills , 3rd Edition</h2><p>The third Canadian edition of Fulton-Calkins/Blaney&#39;s The Administrative Professional is designed to support students as they develop the knowledge and skills necessary to be competitive and successful in today&#39;s office environments.

Blue or E.R.How much of this is a conscious effort, and how much, if any, of this style did you pick up from your experiences as a nurse, or from other literature?<br>A:The truth of the matter is that I have tried my best in my medical thrillers to recreate as closely as I can the medical world that I worked in for 20 years.Like any other group of people who deal with the less pleasant aspects of human behavior on a day to day basis, medical personnel tend to use very strong language and the blackest of humor.As a matter of fact, I've toned down some of Timmie's humor, because the real dialogue in trauma centers sounds much less altruistic, no matter how caring and committed the people are.</p><p>Q:When did you first begin to think about the plot of<i> Brain Dead</i>?Were you inspired by real world events that paralleled the things you write about in the novel?<br>A:The plot for<i> Brain Dead</i> actually began with a joke for my sister, who is divorced.We were talking about some other books I'd done in which I'd vicariously killed off people who had made my nursing life difficult some doctors in<i> A Man to Die For</i>, hospital administrators in <i>Nothing Personal</i>, and lawyers in <i>Bad Medicine</i>.My sister asked me to take care of her problems by killing off ex-husbands.So I incorporated that into <i>Brain Dead</i>.</p><p> I always include some health care issue that I feel strongly about in my novels.In <i>Brain Dead</i>, for example, it turned out to be the struggle between the commercialization of health care, Alzheimers, and how we will all deal with our loved ones and our own failing health.</p><p>Q:How closely do you model the characters in <i>Brain Dead</i> on yourself or co-workers?Has this caused any difficulty or are people flattered by it?<br>A:I believe that most protagonists must share some of the beliefs and prejudices of the creating author.After all, I won't think my character heroic in the least if he or she does not embody at least a few of the principles in which I believe.I'm also told by my family that my voice tends to come through in my lead characters. As for other characters in my books, what I tend to do is steal archetypes.There are certain personality types pulled to any occupation.The kind of person who is good as a floor nurse stinks as an ER nurse and vice versa.If you write about the personality type, people will think they recognize the character.The only character I deliberately stole is my best friend Annie, who shows up as Poppi in <i>A Man to Die For</i>.But, I truly do make it all up<br>Q:What can you tell us about the process of character development in<i> Brain Dead</i>?How did you decide to make the main characters, Timmie Leary and Daniel Murphy, the way they are?<br>A:I spend a lot of time on my main characters before they show up in print.I like the balance of a male-female team so I write both a male and female protagonist into the story.I believe each adds something to the other, and offers insights the other gender doesn1t have. As for Timmie, she was born of my training in death investigation.I wanted her to really love her job as a trauma nurse.I also wanted her to be a fish out of water.Add those things and you get a woman who has loved working at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the largest gun and knife club in the world, but who finds herself broke and home in a bedroom community outside of St. Louis working in a little stop-and-go emergency room where her skills are wasted.Timmie is edgy because she's bored, she's quick and decisive because that is what a trauma nurse needs to be and she's miserable where she is, because it's not what she wants.Timmie also has a certain big-city prejudice about small-town dangers and that makes her a wee bit stubborn about what1s going on.</p><p> Murphy is Timmie's antithesis:Where Timmie acts, Murphy observes; where Timmie lives for the sound of a siren, Murphy dreads it.As a burned out reporter, Murphy wants peace, quiet and oblivion.But he is also, in this small, conservative river town, a fish out of water, which is what draws him to Timmie.He is also the kind of person who can't pass up a puzzle, no matter what he professes.</p><p>Q:What is your next project?<br>A:Right now I'm working on the sequel to <i>Bad Medicine</i>, in which Molly Burke, my Vietnam vet heroine/trauma nurse/death investigator for the city of St. Louis, is forced to reexamine her past in search of a serial killer who seems to have known her and returns to perform for her.The working title is <i>Head Games</i>.</p></p><h2>The Texas Rangers: A Century of Frontier Defense</h2><p><p>Webb's classic history of the Texas Rangers has been popular ever since its first publication in 1935.

I can&#x2019;t believe it!&#x201d; Gretchen said, her pretty green eyes fixed on her computer monitor. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Bobby Jordan.&#x201d; She lowered her voice to a near-whisper, and I knew the juicy part was coming. &#x201c;Riley&#x2019;s not in the photo.&#x201d; She looked at me, her eyes round. &#x201c;Bobby&#x2019;s holding Ruby Bowers&#x2019;s hand.&#x201d;<br>I knew I shouldn&#x2019;t look at the photograph. I didn&#x2019;t want to contribute to the already rampant rumors that Bobby and Riley Jordan&#x2019;s marriage was on the rocks. As I neatened a pile of antiques-themed magazines, tapping the bottom edges to square them up, I told myself to walk away, just walk away. Instead, I found myself rationalizing looking. The photo was, after all, on a public Web site, and I didn&#x2019;t see how taking a quick peek could do any harm. It wasn&#x2019;t as if I were peeping into someone&#x2019;s bedroom, after all. Curiosity and discretion warred inside me, and curiosity won.<br>The photo was just as Gretchen described.<br>I shrugged, feigning a lack of interest. &#x201c;Maybe Riley&#x2019;s just out of the shot,&#x201d; I said.<br>&#x201c;I suppose&nbsp;... or maybe she&#x2019;s in the ladies&#x2019; room.&#x201d; Gretchen stared at the photo for a moment longer, then turned to face me. &#x201c;Do you think they&#x2019;re...&#x201d;<br>I didn&#x2019;t know how to respond.<br>Bobby Jordan was the founder of the trendy Rocky Point&#x2013;based, blue-themed restaurant chain, and since he was as charismatic as he was handsome, his occasional TV appearances had opened a floodgate of work and social opportunities. Within a year, he&#x2019;d become one of the most recognizable celebrity chefs in the world. He was also a former Olympic biathlon medal winner&#x2014;and the grandson of Babs Miller, one of America&#x2019;s sweethearts, an Olympic figure skating champion in the 1930s and one of the first female graduates of Hitchens University. Bobby&#x2019;s flagship restaurant, the Blue Dolphin, was my favorite hangout.<br>Riley, his wife of seven years, was more reserved. She exuded ladylike elegance. If there had been a New Hampshire Best Dressed List, she&#x2019;d have been at the top. She was also a serious collector of vintage clothing and had recently started a small consulting business advising museums and individuals on how to build their twentieth-century designer clothing collections. Her book,&nbsp;<i>Collecting Vintage Clothing,</i>&nbsp;had brought her instantaneous acclaim in the fashion world.<br>During my first year in Rocky Point, I&#x2019;d heard Riley speak at the Rocky Point Woman&#x2019;s Club. Her topic had been &#x201c;Letting Your Passion Drive Your Collecting.&#x201d; She&#x2019;d focused on her own favorite collectibles, vintage clothing, specifically the sexy and glamorous gowns designed by Bob Mackie and the practical and stylish separates designed by Claire McCardell, the groundbreaking inventor of &#x201c;ready-to-wear&#x201d; fashion. I&#x2019;d been transfixed. Not only had Riley&#x2019;s presentation been filled with insider stories, she&#x2019;d been a terrific speaker: energetic, accessible, and informative. I could trace my fascination with vintage clothing to Riley&#x2019;s fun and inspiring program.<br>Bobby and Riley Jordan were a golden couple, and it was awful to think that their relationship was unraveling.<br>I looked at the photo again. Ruby Bowers was a bona fide A-list movie star. She was tall and ethereal, in her early thirties and single, and her comings and goings were constant fodder for the gossip magazines. I knew this because Gretchen, the first employee I&#x2019;d hired when I opened Prescott&#x2019;s Antiques &amp; Auctions six years earlier, had an addiction to celebrity gossip and chattered about her all the time. In this shot, Ruby was wearing Versace. Bobby&#x2019;s tux had been tailored by a pro.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t the first time Ruby&#x2019;s name had been connected to Bobby&#x2019;s. Lurid headlines in cheesy tabloids had become the norm. According to Riley there was nothing to it but a publicity stunt that seemed to be working. Ruby had started frequenting Bobby&#x2019;s New York City Blue Apple restaurant last fall, and he, a smart and ambitious businessman, had leveraged their burgeoning friendship into priceless publicity. Ditto for Ruby. Occasionally, Riley tagged along on their outings, but as Riley had explained to me over lunch a month earlier, whereas Bobby was in his element smiling for the paparazzi and waving to Ruby&#x2019;s fans, she hated being in the spotlight. Other rumors swirled around Bobby, too, and not just about his alleged affairs. One gossip column Gretchen had told me about speculated that his newfound fame had gone to his head, that with his jet-setting lifestyle and aggressive expansion plans, he was nearly broke.<br>I sighed, still staring at the photograph of Bobby, with his chiseled features facing the camera, his eyes alight with pleasure, and Ruby, larger than life and as magnificent as always, in her shimmering gold lam� gown, flashing a radiant, Botox-enhanced smile.<br>Gretchen was waiting for me to speak. I didn&#x2019;t want to add fuel to the already smoldering fire, and I didn&#x2019;t want the rumors to be true. Bobby and Riley were good customers and good friends. I liked them both&#x2014;a lot. Plus, I&#x2019;d been in grammar school when I&#x2019;d learned that there was no upside to gossip.<br>I smiled at Gretchen and shrugged. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure their holding hands is completely innocent,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Bobby&#x2019;s in chef-to-the-stars mode, so it makes sense he&#x2019;d be hanging out with a movie star like Ruby Bowers at some tony Broadway opening party.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Gretchen said, gazing at the screen.<br>I could tell from her tone that she didn&#x2019;t for a minute believe it.<br>Neither did I.<br>Just last week, I&#x2019;d asked my boyfriend, Ty Alverez&#x2014;the former Rocky Point police chief and a current training manager for Homeland Security&#x2014;what he thought about their alleged affair. He&#x2019;d smiled at me, a private, just-for-me smile that started in his eyes.<br>&#x201c;I think Bobby&#x2019;s insane to be messing around with an empty gown like Ruby,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but that&#x2019;s because compared to you, she&#x2019;s nothing but a pretty face. I don&#x2019;t know what Bobby thinks of Riley. Maybe in his mind, Ruby&#x2019;s a hot ticket.&#x201d;<br>I&#x2019;d leaned my head against Ty&#x2019;s shoulder and smiled, luxuriating in the knowledge that the man of my dreams wanted me above all others, including a gorgeous-to-the-max movie star.<br>I shook off the memory and picked up a copy of Riley&#x2019;s book from the stack on Gretchen&#x2019;s desk.<br>&#x201c;How many copies did you get?&#x201d; I asked Gretchen, consciously changing the subject.<br>&#x201c;A dozen,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;I figure that whatever doesn&#x2019;t sell at tomorrow&#x2019;s class will sell in the boutique. I thought I&#x2019;d put up a display by the cash register.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good thinking!&#x201d; I said, pleased at her initiative.<br>Gretchen had started as a receptionist when I&#x2019;d opened Prescott&#x2019;s. She&#x2019;d moved up to chief cashier and administrative manager, and in the last month, she&#x2019;d taken on a major new responsibility&#x2014;managing one of our two newest ventures, the small boutique we&#x2019;d added called Prescott&#x2019;s Vintage Fashions. I&#x2019;d opened it after I&#x2019;d purchased the entire inventory of a Manhattan consignment shop. The owner, a woman named Lana whom I&#x2019;d known since my days working in the city, had called last fall saying she wanted to retire and move to the Bahamas. She&#x2019;d made me an offer I couldn&#x2019;t refuse, and overnight, we were in the vintage clothing business.<br>I was taking care of the other new undertaking myself&#x2014;a workshop series. &#x201c;Prescott&#x2019;s Antiques &amp; Collectibles: How to Build a Great Vintage Clothing Collection.&#x201d; Tomorrow evening&#x2019;s class, the third in the series, was scheduled to cover shoes and handbags, and I&#x2019;d invited Riley to co-facilitate. I was thrilled that she&#x2019;d accepted my offer, and I hoped her book would sell like hotcakes.<br>&#x201c;I wish I could take credit,&#x201d; Gretchen said, laughing, &#x201c;but it was Ava&#x2019;s idea!&#x201d; She nodded at Ava Marlow, our new intern, a graduate student at nearby Hitchens University.<br>&#x201c;Kudos to Ava, then,&#x201d; I replied, smiling at her, then turning back to Gretchen, &#x201c;but managing a team takes talent, too, so you get credit as well.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks!&#x201d; Gretchen said, her expressive eyes sparkling at the compliment.<br>&#x201c;Speaking of a team effort,&#x201d; Ava said, standing up and stretching, &#x201c;cataloguing Prescott&#x2019;s incredible vintage clothing collection makes a girl hungry! I&#x2019;m going to run over to Westil&#x2019;s Deli. Can I bring anyone anything?&#x201d;<br>Ava, in her midtwenties, was a little taller than me, about five-three or so, with platinum blond hair styled in an angle-cut bob and intelligent, dark brown eyes. Not only was she smart and a quick learner, she was innately curious, a must-have quality for an antiques appraiser. She researched carefully, wrote well, and chatted with customers with ease. She also had a terrific work ethic. In addition to attending grad school full-time and interning part-time for us, she spent most of her weekends waitressing at the Blue Dolphin for extra money&#x2014;and she sewed her own clothes to boot. Today she wore a dark orange raw silk sheath with a brown nubby silk jacket. Her only jewelry was a long, heavy silver link chain that disappeared under her dress. She looked like a million bucks. I was already formulating plans to offer her a full-time job when she graduated.<br>We all said no, thank you, we didn&#x2019;t want anything. She slipped in her iPod earphones and left, setting the wind chimes Gretchen had hung on the door shortly after we opened tinkling.<br>I watched as she strolled across the parking lot toward her car, th...</p><h2>Inventing Ireland (Convergences: Inventories of the Present)</h2><p><p>Just as Ireland has produced many brilliant writers in the past century, so these writers have produced a new Ireland. In a book unprecedented in its scope and approach, Declan Kiberd offers a vivid account of the personalities and texts, English and Irish alike, that reinvented the country after centuries of colonialism. The result is a major literary history of modern Ireland, combining detailed and daring interpretations of literary masterpieces with assessments of the wider role of language, sport, clothing, politics, and philosophy in the Irish revival.</p><p>In dazzling comparisons with the experience of other postcolonial peoples, the author makes many overdue connections. Rejecting the notion that artists such as Wilde, Shaw, Yeats, Joyce, and Beckett became modern to the extent that they made themselves "European," he contends that the Irish experience was a dramatic instance of experimental modernity and shows how the country's artists blazed a trail that led directly to the magic realism of a Garc�a M�rquez or a Rushdie. Along the way, he reveals the vital importance of Protestant values and the immense contributions of women to the enterprise. Kiberd's analysis of the culture is interwoven with sketches of the political background, bringing the course of modern Irish literature into sharp relief against a tragic history of conflict, stagnation, and change.</p><p><i>Inventing Ireland</i> restores to the Irish past a sense of openness that it once had and that has since been obscured by narrow-gauge nationalists and their polemical revisionist critics. In closing, Kiberd outlines an agenda for Irish Studies in the next century and detects the signs of a second renaissance in the work of a new generation of authors and playwrights, from Brian Friel to the younger Dublin writers.</p></p><p>Declan Kiberd offers a vivid account of the personalities and texts - English and Irish alike - that reinvented Ireland after centuries of colonialism.

Dick in the winter and spring of 1960, in Point Reyes Station, California. In the sequence of Dick s work, The Man Whose Teeth was written immediately after Confessions of a Crap Artist; the next book Dick wrote was The Man in the High Castle, the Hugo Award winning science fiction novel that ushered in the next stage of Dick s career. This novel, Dick said, is about Leo Runcible, a brilliant, civicminded liberal Jew living in a rural WASP town in Marin County, California. Runcible, a real estate agent involved in a local battle with a neighbor, finds what look like Neanderthal bones and dreams of rising real estate prices because of the publicity.</p><p><p>Philip K. Dick&nbsp;has had many movies based on his stories, including the classic, <i>Blade Runner</i>.</p><p>Praise for <i>The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike</i>:<br><br>&#x201c;In 1981, Dick re-read his eleven unpublished novels and selected [<i>The Man Whose Teeth Were All Exactly Alike</i>] as his favorite of the lot.... It tells the story of an out-of-place Jewish realtor with a certain simple appeal. The hero&#x2019;s principles seem strong and clear, if somewhat eccentric...a tragi-comedy where all involved trample blindly on each other&#x2019;s sensibilities.&#x201d;<br><i>&#x2014;Locus<br><br></i>&#x201c;Whether writing brilliantly idiosyncratic science fiction or uniquely Dickian contemporary novels, Philip K. Dick was a major American literary talent who deserves an even wider audience than the formidable one he reached in his lifetime. This novel may be (as Dick himself believed) the best of all his unpublished mainstream works.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Michael Bishop</p></p><h2>Sunset Landscaping with Stone: Natural-Looking Paths, Steps, Walls, Water Features, and Rock Gardens</h2><p>A fundamental resource for realizing the potential of virtually any garden focuses on the resilience and color of stone and includes step-by-step instructions for everything from patios to walls and waterfalls.

A first novel. Reissue.</p><p>PJ Parrish has worked as a newspaper reporter and editor, arts reviewer, blackjack dealer and personnel director in a Mississippi casino. The author currently lives in Southaven Mississippi and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.An overwrought debut thriller set in the not-quite-ready-to-be-new South. It's 1983. To Black Pool, Mississippi, returns native Lewis Kincaid, drawn there by a dying mother. Not that he likes her muchshe's a drunk, plus she deserted himbut Lewis is never one to shirk his duty. She's black, Lewis's equally no-account father was white, and Lewis can think of a dozen places he'd rather be than in a town where biracial means second class at best. Theres Detroit, for instance, where he enjoyed the beginnings of a nice career in law. Now, however, to help pay the bills while he keeps his deathwatch, Lewis hires on as a deputy to Sheriff Dodie. It's a chance gig, which is to say it happens by telephone: Dodie, worn, weary, and a little dim, hires Lewis under the impression that he's white. Still, Dodiethat seeming redneckhas other sides to him. When the skeleton of a teenaged young black boy, victim of a 30-year-old lynching, is discovered, Dodie permits Lewis to investigate. It's permission granted reluctantly, of course. ``Things like that are part of the past,'' Dodie says. Not to be dissuaded, Lewis starts to dig, an activity that rouses almost as little enthusiasm among the towns blacks as it does among its whites. Unwelcome, unpopular Lewis gets beaten, shot, and nearly lynched himself. But indomitable amalgam of super- and soaper-hero that he is, he takes on all comers, resists all temptation (an adorable white girl throws herself at him harder than a Nolan Ryan fastball), and leaves Black Pool a degree more enlightened than when he arrived. Clumsy prose, stereotyped peopleand a first novelist who has to learn that in plotting the twist is better than the wrench. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Opening with the young Clark Kent on a date, the novel takes an entirely fresh approach to the emergence of his superpowers and the start of his newspaper career, following him from rural 1930s Kansas across america to Hollywood in its golden age, and then to New York City. He meets a worldly Lois Lane and conniving political boss Lex Luthor, and begins his battles against criminal masterminds, mad scientists, and supervillains inspired by fascists. Sure to appeal to fans of the TV show <i>Smallville</i> and the novel <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay</i>, as well as devoted comic book readers, <i>It's Superman</i> is a fun and fast-paced novel of thrilling invention, heroic escapades, ill-fitting costumes, and super-sized coming-of-age angst.</p><p>Tom De Haven is the author of eight novels, including the Derby Dugan trilogy, hailed a wild ride&#34; by the Boston Globe and &#34;brimming with life and characters&#34; by the New York Times Books Review. A frequent contributor to Entertainment Weekly and the NewIt's Superman all right, but not one most fans have ever seen. Tom De Haven's realistic story explores how a nervous Superboy becomes a confident Superman in a very adult story. Scott Brick lays out a good yarn that begins in 1935 and ends in 1938, when Superman goes public. Brick's trademark delivery, with sentences ending in upturned final syllables, works well in this story of a fumbling Clark Kent learning to shed his Smallville skin. Superman purists may object to Clark's smoking and drinking, and to his leaving Pa Kent alone on the farm while he takes up wandering the country like Woody Guthrie. Likewise, Lois Lane is surprisingly slutty, and Lex Luthor is almost unrecognizable as a Manhattan alderman.

After the Civil War Boston underwent a radical and successful transformation from a declining mercantile home port to an important and competitive modern seaport. At the same time the transition from sail to steam was taking place. Photographic studies of deep water sail and steam vessels, naval ships, fishing boats, catboats, tugs, schooners, and sloops, and of the picturesque wharves--all create a kaleidoscopic visual history of these years of change. </p><p> The volume offers, as well, some of the most distinguished early work in photography, including the widest selection ever published of photographs by pioneer marine photographer Nathaniel Stebbins. </p></p><p>Portrait Of A Port is a classic portrayal of Boston&#39;s glorious maritime past opens a window onto the history of American port cities.<b> W.

Demi's paintings are full of bright, intricate patterns, and bold touches of gold produce a feeling of awe and splendor. The images are somewhat traditional in their depictions of winged angels and a white-haired God figure above the frame of several illustrations. This book is a beautiful creation, and a reverent tribute. However, it does not have a lot of appeal for children. The art, all enclosed in a series of frames, looks static and self-contained. The small size of the text makes it difficult to read. The biblical passages have an undeniable beauty, but no adjustments or simplifications have been made to make the language more accessible to a young audience. This volume will be a source of inspiration for readers already familiar with the story of Jesus. To introduce the topic to children, consider Sally Grindley's <i>The Life of Jesus</i> (DK, 2003) or Brian Wildsmith's <i>Jesus</i> (Eerdmans, 2004).<i>&#x2013;Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But was she really willing to let him take over her life and possibly her heart?<br><br></p><p>Romance readers around the world were sad to note the passing of Betty Neels in June 2001.Her career spanned thirty years, and she continued to write into her ninetieth year.To her millions of fans, Betty epitomized the romance writer.Betty&#x2019;s first book, Sister Peters in Amsterdam,was published in 1969, and she eventually completed 134 books.Her novels offer a reassuring warmth that was very much a part of her own personality.Her spirit and genuine talent live on in all her stories.The early morning sun of a midsummer's day morning shone with warm cheerfulness on to the quiet countryside, the market town tucked neatly into the Cotswold hills and its numerous windows. These included those of the Cottage Hospital, a symbol of former days, fought for and triumphantly reprieved from the remorseless hand of authority, and proving its worth tenfold by never having an empty bed.<p>Inside the grey stone walls of this Victorian edifice, the day's work was already well advanced. Its thirty beds were divided between surgical and medical patients, with two beds for maternity cases who couldn't make it in time to Bristol or Bath, and one private ward used for any child too ill to move or anyone too ill to nurse in the wards. There was a small outpatients' department, too, and a casualty room where the local GPs could be called to attend any accident. Small it might be, but it did yeoman service, easing the burden of patients on the big Bristol hospitals.</p><p>It was staffed by the local doctors, ably supported by Miss Hawkins, who still insisted on being called Matron, two ward sisters and their staff nurses, and four pupil nurses, sent from Bristol and Bath to gain experience.</p><p>There was a night sister, too, and a handful of nursing aides, local ladies, whose kindness of heart and willingness to work hard when everyone else was fast asleep more than made up for their lack of nursing skills. Miss Hawkins was nearing retirement age, an old&#x2013;fashioned martinet who had no intention of changing her ways. Until six months ago she had had the willing co&#x2013;operation of Sister Coffin on the medical ward but that lady had retired and her place had been taken by a young staff nurse from the Bristol Royal Infirmary, who had accepted the post of sister in preference to a more prestigious one at her own hospital. It was agreed by everyone, even the grudging Miss Hawkins, that she had proved her ability and was worth her weight in gold. She had a happy knack of getting her patients better, coping with emergencies without fuss, carrying out the various doctors' orders faithfully, and lending a sympathetic ear to the young nurses' requests for a particular day off duty.</p><p>She sat at the desk in her office now, the sun gilding the mousy hair pinned neatly under her frilled cap, warming her ordinary face, escaping plainness only by virtue of a pair of fine hazel eyes, thickly lashed, and a gentle mouth. The desk was more or less covered by charts and a variety of forms and she had a pen in her hand, although just for the moment she was doing no work at all, her thoughts far away, if rather vague. She was normally a sensible girl, prepared to accept what life had to offer her and not expecting anything very exciting to happen. Indeed, the three elderly aunts with whom she lived had imbued her with this idea from an early age. They prided themselves on their honesty and plain spokenness and had pointed out on a number of occasions her lack of good looks and amusing conversation. They had done their best to dissuade her</p><p>from training as a nurse, too, but she had been surprisingly stubborn; despite their certainty that she was too quiet, too shy with strangers, and lacking in self&#x2013;assurance, she had gone to Bristol, done her training, and emerged at the end of it with flying colours: Gold Medallist of her year, the prospect of a ward sister's post in the not too distant future, and a circle of firm friends. The girls liked her because she listened to the details of their complicated love lives with sympathy. The young housemen liked her because she listened to them, too, about their fleeting love affairs and their dreams of being brilliant consultants. She sympathised with them when they failed their exams and rejoiced with them when they passed and, when on night duty, she was always a willing maker of hot cocoa when one or other of them had been hauled out of bed in the small hours.</p><p>But she had declined the ward offered her and had instead applied for and been appointed to the medical ward of the Cottage Hospital in her home town. All because her youngest aunt, Janet, had had a slight&#x2014;very slight&#x2014;heart attack and it had been impressed upon her by Aunt Kate and Aunt Polly that it was her duty to return home.</p><p>So she had come back to the small town and lived out, going to and fro from her aunts' rambling old house not ten minutes' walk from the hospital. And because she was a good nurse and loved her work, she had taken pride in changing the medical ward, with patience and a good deal of tact, into the more modern methods Sister Coffin had ignored. It had been uphill work but she had managed it so well that Matron considered that she had been the instigator of change in the first place. If she regretted leaving her training school and the splendid opportunities it had offered her, she had never said so, but just now and again</p><p>she wondered if life would have been different if she had taken the post at Bristol. She would have kept her friends for a start and used her nursing talents to their utmost; and who knew, perhaps one day she might have met someone who would want to marry her.</p><p>She stifled a sigh and looked up with a smile as her staff nurse came in. Jenny Topps was a big girl, always cheerful and amiable and with no wish to be anything but a staff nurse. She was getting married in a year's time to a rather silent and adoring young farmer and her ambitions lay in being a good wife. She said now,</p><p>'We're ready, Sister. There's time for a quick cup of tea before Dr Beecham gets here. I've sent the little nurses to coffee; Mrs Wills&#x2014;the nursing auxilary&#x2014;is in the ward.'</p><p>'Good. Yes, let's have tea, then I'll go over to the Women's Medical. It's quiet there and Staff can cope, but I'll just take another look at Miss Prosser. Mr Owen's not responding to his antibiotic, is he? I'll see if Dr Beecham will change it. He might be better off at the Infirmary.' She took the mug of tea Jenny had fetched from the ward kitchen and sipped it.</p><p>'You must miss the Infirmary,' observed Jenny. 'It's pretty quiet here&#x2014;bad chests and diabetics and the odd heart case...'</p><p>She studied Sister Manning's quiet face on the other side of the desk; she liked her and admired her and although she wasn't pretty she had a pretty name&#x2014;Francesca.</p><p>'Well, yes, I do, but I do need to be nearby my aunts...' She finished her tea, got to her feet and said, 'I'll be back in five minutes. Get the nurses to start making up that empty bed, will you? There is a diabetic coming in at two o'clock.'</p><p>The ward was quiet, the men waiting for the bi&#x2013;weekly</p><p>round from the consultant. Most of them were on the mend. Mr Owen worried her a little, and the new patient who had come in during the night, a suspected coronary, might spring something on them. She went slowly down the old&#x2013;fashioned but cheerful ward, stopping for a word here and there and casting an eye on these two, and then went through the door into the women's side.</p><p>Here she was met by her second staff nurse, a small dark girl who like herself lived out.</p><p>'All ready for Dr Beecham?' asked Francesca. 'How's Miss Prosser? She was a bit cyanosed when I did the round this morning.'</p><p>'Still a bit blue. She's had some oxygen and she's quite bright and cheerful.'</p><p>They stood together and looked along the facing row of beds. It was a small ward with pretty curtains at the windows and round each bed, and plenty of flowers. Half the patients were up, sitting by their beds, knitting or reading or gossiping. Francesca walked slowly to Miss Prosser's bed and made small talk while she studied that lady. They had had her in before and she was by no means an easy patient; she would have to talk to Dr Beecham about her. She smiled and nodded at the other patients and went back to her office, tidied the top of her desk, and with a glance at the clock went back to the men's ward. Dr Beecham would be there at any moment now.</p><p>He came through the door within moments, a short stout man with a fringe of hair on a bald head and twinkling blue eyes. She had known him ever since she had begun her training; he had been one of the first lecturers she had had and as she became more senior he had occasionally explained some unusual case to her. She liked him and the smile which lighted up her face made it almost pretty.</p><p>He had someone with him. Not just Dr Stokes, who was the RMO; a tall man with massive shoulders, fair hair with a heavy sprinkling of grey and the good looks to turn any woman's head. Francesca sighed at the sight of him. She knew him, too: Dr van Rijgen, a specialist in tropical diseases who had come to the Infirmary at regular intervals to lecture the students. He lived in Holland and worked there as far as she knew, although he seemed equally at home in England. Years ago when she had begun her training she had had the misfortune to drop off during one of his lectures; even after all these years, she remembered his cold voice, laced with sarcasm, very quietly reducing her to a state bordering on hysteria. They had encountered each other since then, of course, and she had taken care never to allow her feelings to show, and he for his part had never betrayed any recollection of that first unfortunate meeting. He eyed her now with a kind of thoughtful amusement which made her fume inwardly. But she replied suitably to Dr Stokes and Dr Beecham and then bade him a frosty good morning.</p><p>He had a deep slow voice. 'Good morning, Sister Manning. I see that I must congratulate you since we last met at the Infirmary.' He glanced round the ward, half the size of those in a Bristol hospital. 'Hiding your light under a bushel?'</p><p>She said in a voice which made his fine mouth twitch, 'If I remember aright, sir, my light was a very small one&#x2014;a mere glimmer.'</p><p>He gave a crack of laughter. 'Oh, dear, you have a long memory, Sister.'</p><p>'A useful thing in ...</p></p><h2>Rescuing Eden: Preserving America&#39;s Historic Gardens</h2><p>From simple 18th- and early 19th-century gardens to the lavish estates of the Gilded Age, the gardens started by 1930s inmates at Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay to the centuries-old camellias at Middleton Place near Charleston, South Carolina&#x2014;<i>Rescuing Eden</i> celebrates the history of garden design in the United States, with 28 examples that have been saved by ardent conservationists and generous private owners, and opened to the public.<br><br> The United States has a rich tradition of landscape design, with gardens on a scale that rivaled the great gardens of Europe, but in the absence of specific institutions dedicated to their preservation, many of these &#x201c;ephemeral collaborations between man and nature&#x201d; were lost&#x2014;during the wars, economic depressions, and social upheavals that swept the country in the mid-20th-century, or to creeping development and urban sprawl. The surviving gardens presented here were selected for the drama of their original creation and rescue and for their historical and horticultural importance.<i> </i>Ranging from wonderful to woebegone, each has its own character, and each has been brought back from the brink through a combination of imagination and tenacity. <br><br> Discover The Kampong in Miami, Florida, planted with hundreds of tropical rarities from Southeast Asia by legendary plant explorer Dr. David Fairchild; Barnsley Gardens in Georgia, one of the few antebellum gardens surviving in the South, planted with 200 varieties of roses; the Lynchburg, Virginia garden created by Harlem Renaissance poet and civil rights activist Anne Spencer; the eccentric Ladew Topiary Gardens, with 15 garden rooms and a topiary foxhunt; the Belle Epoque grandeur of the Untermyer Garden in Yonkers, New York; and many others across the country, in Kentucky, Texas, Michigan, Maine, Rhode Island, and California. Each garden has been specially photographed by noted landscape and garden photographer Curtice Taylor, and introduced with authoritative and engaging text from design historian Caroline Seebohm, encouraging readers to appreciate the landscapes that serve not only as windows on American history, but living, flourishing pleasure grounds for botanists, horticulturalists, and nature lovers throughout the United States.</p><p>Caroline Seebohm is a design historian and biographer. A prolific author, her books include <i>Boca Rococo</i>, a biography of Palm Beach architect Addison Mizner, <i>At Home with Books</i>, and <i>Cottages and Mansions of the Jersey Shore</i>, as well as biographies of Marietta Tree, Conde Nast, and tennis legend Pancho Segura. <br> &nbsp;<br> Curtice Tayor is a well-known landscape and garden photographer whose work is widely published. He teaches photography at the School of Visual Arts in New York."If ever there was a sign of how gardens can offer hope, it must be the &#x2018;dazzling array of blooming borders&#x2019; developed in the 1930s at the notorious Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, where an inmate wrote that tilling and planting the hillside became his &#x2018;refuge&#x2019; and &#x2018;release&#x2019;. But like many of the gardens photographed so enthrallingly by Curtice Taylor in this book, its glories quickly turned to weeds when it closed in 1963.&nbsp;Curtice writes movingly of how his career was launched when Russell Page asked him to document a deeply loved private garden that was subsequently razed. Haunted by the loss, he became intrigued by other gardens that had been saved. Caroline Seebohm&#x2019;s narratives, involving the creation, loss and rediscovery of 30 gardens, are peopled with painters, poets, opera singers, civil rights activists&nbsp;and heroic widows, making for an irresistible mix. And what encouragement for designers to find out how ingeniously and passionately people fought to preserve these landscapes, many of which reflect English tradition. Even the flora of Alcatraz has now been replanted. Where gardens are concerned, the act of rescue is usually reciprocal."<br>&#x2014;<i><b>Garden Design Journal</b></i><br><br>"Arranged chronologically, from Colonial days and the Gilded Age to the best of contemporary gardens, <i>Rescuing Eden&nbsp;</i>features the famous historic examples, such as Middleton Place, as well as newer ones that are not so well known outside this country."<br>&#x2014;<i><b>Hortus</b></i><br><br>"Lacking a substantial conservation organization, such as England&#x2019;s National Trust, many of America&#x2019;s greatest gardens are threatened in various ways: the death of owners, encroaching developers, etc. This beautiful book by design historian Caroline Seebohm profiles 30 gardens that are being preserved, either by local citizens groups or through generous donations.

When eighth grader Kate and her Uncle George (who is two years younger than her) receive letters inviting them to attend the Whittaker Magnet School, home of nasty protein shakes and the freakish "Test-Based Curriculum," their reactions are mixed. George, somewhat of a genius, is pleased, while Kate is horrified. Still, as a search on-line reveals, their house is suddenly in the Whittaker school district, so off they go. It's not long, before they discover something very strange is afoot at their new school. For one thing, the Whittaker-Austin family has rather alarming delusions of grandeur. For another, it seems a number of people have died at the school under mysterious circumstances. Then there's the librarian called Pogo, who speaks only in Mother Goose rhymes. With the President of the United States on his way for a tour of the school, the Whittaker-Austins want to make sure everything goes as smoothly as possible--meaning no dead bodies in the soft drink cooler, no shenanigans from the mushroom-pale zombie students, and definitely no unscheduled visits from the resident demon. <p> As in his previous young adult novels, <i>Tangerine</i> and <i>Crusader</i>, Bloor's characters sparkle with life (or glow with unearthly non-life...). <i>Story Time</i> is hilarious, biting, and tremendously fun to read.

Or the tiny gift-wrapped box from a recently departed lover that reveals a horrible secret? Everyone knows contemporary legends, those barely believable, often lurid, cautionary tales, always told as though they happened to the friend of a friend. Sometimes we pass them on to others unsure of their truthfulness, usually we dismiss them as mere myth. But these far-fetched legends tell us quite a bit about our deepest fears and fantasies.</p> <p>In fact, a large part of what we know about our bodies we have learned informally, from kids on the playground or colleagues at work, from piecing together the information contained in folk beliefs, jokes and legends. Sexual folklore goes beyond classroom lessons of mechanics to answer many questions about what people actually do and how they do it.</p> <p>Mariamne H. Whatley and Elissa R. Henken have collected hundreds of sexually-themed stories and jokes from college students in order to tell us what they reveal about our sexual attitudes and show us how they have changed over time. They confront myths and stereotypes about sexual behavior and use folklore as a tool to educate students about sexual health and gender relations. Whether analyzing popular rumors about celebrity emergency room visits or the latest schoolyard jokes, <b>Did You Hear About The Girl Who . . . ? </b>presents these tales in a way that is intriguing and educational.</p></p><p><p><b>Mariamne H. Whatley</b> is Associate Dean of the School of Education at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. </p><p>"Whatley and Henkin have written a book that is as intelligent as it is interesting and funny."</p>-<i>Journal of Sex Research</i><br><br><p>"This is a must read for sexuality educators and youth workers concerned about the power of pedagogy and folklore as they swirl in the minds of youth. Whatley and Henken construct a magnificent argument about listening to the beliefs, the jokes, the sometimes very wrong headed, sometimes brilliant folklore narrated by youth as we accompany them into conversations about sexuality, health, desire, and danger. If adults can be useful at all, it is only with the guidance of Whatley and Henken that we have a chance at engaging with, rather than lecturing to, the fertile minds and bodies of America's youth. This book is fun, clever, engaging and provocative."</p>-Michelle Fine,CUNY Graduate Center, author of <i>Framing Dropouts: Notes on the Politics of an Urban High School</i><br><br><p>"An entertaining and useful book which describes the ways in which folklore might be used to enhance sex and relationships education."</p>-<i>Sex Education Matters</i><br><br><p>"Books that deal with adolescent sexuality have one of two audiences: adults or teens. Finally a book that bridges what often appears to be an unbridgeable chasm. Henken, a folklorist, explains what young people are&#x2014;really&#x2014;saying to each other in their private moments; while Whatley, a biologist and health educator, provides the correctives to these rumors and folk beliefs. The book, written in a lively style, takes the reality of boys and girls seriously, while never flinching from providing the best health information available. While many of the stories presented may be disturbing, each presents how gender and sexuality is interpreted. This is a book that should serve as a standard text for courses on sexuality in high schools, colleges, and for parents who want to know what their children believe."</p>-Gary Alan Fine,Northwestern University, author of <i>Manufacturing Tales: Sex and Money in Contemporary Legends</i><br><br><p>"A book with a wonderful interdisciplinary idea-using sexual urban legends as part of high school and college sex education."</p> -<i>The Women's Review of Books</i>,Oct. 2001</p><h2>The Revolt of the Masses</h2><p><p><strong>Social upheaval in early 20th-century Europe is the historical setting for this seminal study by the Spanish philosopher, Jos� Ortega y Gasset.

For this new collection, Claiborne's longtime editor, Joan Whitman, has selected the best recipes from Craig Claiborne's The New New York Times Cookbook (co-authored with Pierre Franey) and three other classic cookbooks, <i>Cooking with Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey, Craig Claiborne's Southern Cooking</i>, and <i>Craig Claiborne's Gourmet Diet</i>. <br><br>Among the distinguishing features of Craig Claiborne's culinary genius is the inspired way he marries flavors from all corners of the globe.

The result is the diverse repertoire that helped to revolutionize American cuisine. <br><br>The delicious recipes in this peerless collection range from classic American regional dishes like Southern Fried Chicken, Jambalaya, and New England Boiled Dinner to international delights such as the Mediterranean fish soup Bourride, Vietnamese Grilled Lemon Duck, Curried Thai Shrimp, Yakitori (Japanese Skewered Chicken), Cassoulet from France, Paella from Spain, Tangy Chinese Noodles, Ossobuco Milanese, Indian Keema with Peas, and Caribbean-Style Stuffed Crabs. These dishes represent the creative contributions of renowned chefs and gifted home cooks with whom Claiborne has maintained an active culinary correspondence for many years. <br><br>Particularly noteworthy here are the immeasurable contributions of the late Pierre Franey. The former chef of the acclaimed Pavillon restaurant in New York and author of the New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet series, Franey collaborated with Claiborne to expand the frontiers of fine cooking.

By the Armistice of November 1918, General John J.Pershing&#39;s American Expeditionary Force in France had more than 2 million men and was holding 25 per cent of the Western Front. They had helped smash Ludendorff&#39;s brilliant Operation &#34;Michael&#34; in the lines before Paris; had turned onto the offensive themselves at St Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne; and if Germany had not negotiated peace with unexpected speed the US Army would have taken over from their tired Allies an even greater share of the planned 1919 campaign. This concise account of America&#39;s first world class army, its organization, uniforms, weapons and character, is illustrated with rare photos and eight full color plates.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Mark R.

During his fifty-eight years on this good, green earth, Boris Henson, born and reared in northeast DC, had been homeless and broke, an alcoholic and physically and mentally abusive to my mother during their five years together&#x2014;plus prone to hot tempers and cool-off periods in the slammer. With that many strikes against his character, I can imagine that it&#x2019;s hard for some to see the good in who he was, much less how any comparison to him might be construed as a compliment. But Daddy wasn&#x2019;t average. Yes, there are plenty of fathers who, grappling with their demons, make the babies and leave the mamas and disappear like the wind, without a care in the world about the consequences. The scars run deep. That, however, is not my tale to tell. The truth is, no matter how loud the thunder created by his personal storms, my father always squared his shoulders, extended his arms, opened his heart, and did what was natural and right and beautiful&#x2014;he loved me. My father&#x2019;s love was all at once regular and extraordinary, average and heroic. For starters, he was there. No matter his circumstances, no matter what kind of fresh hell he was dealing with or dishing out, he was there, even if he had to insist upon being a part of my life. One of my earliest memories of my dad is of him kidnapping me. It happened when I was about four years old, shortly after my father dragged my mother by her hair into his car while threatening to kill her. I&#x2019;m told that the only thing that kept her from being dragged down the street with her body hanging out of his ride was my aunt&#x2019;s quick thinking: she pulled the keys out of the ignition before my father could speed away. He was angry because more than a week earlier, my mother, fearful that my father would follow through on a threat to kill her, packed up a few of our belongings in a brown paper bag and plotted a speedy getaway; she wanted to divorce him and bar him from seeing me until he got himself together and handled his bouts of addiction and anger. But my father wasn&#x2019;t having it. &#x201c;Nothing and nobody was gonna keep me away from my baby girl,&#x201d; he used to tell me when he recounted the days when my mom and I disappeared. He said he even took to the top of buildings throughout our hardscrabble southeast DC neighborhood with binoculars to see if he could spot us. We were long gone, though, hiding out where he didn&#x2019;t think to look: back and forth between his parents&#x2019; home in northeast DC and his sister&#x2019;s place in Nanjemoy, a small town in southern Maryland.<br> <br>It took Dad more than a week to track us down at my aunt&#x2019;s place, and when he finally made it over there, he waged war on her front door, banging and hollering like a madman, demanding to see me, his daughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me see my baby!&#x201d; he yelled. &#x201c;Taraji! Come see your daddy!&#x201d;<br> <br>I was in the television room, which was in the back of the apartment, in a thin pair of pajamas, watching television and pulling a comb through my doll&#x2019;s hair when I heard my father screaming my name. That doll didn&#x2019;t have a chance; I left it, the comb, a brush, and a bowl of barrettes and baubles right there in the middle of the floor and started rooting around the recliner for my sneakers with the flowers on them when my mom, a naturally gorgeous cocoa beauty with a beautiful halo of hair, rushed into the room to check on me. &#x201c;Come here,&#x201d; she said, scooping me up into her arms. She sat on the edge of the couch, rocking side to side; her palm, warm and slightly sweaty, pressed my head against her chest. The thud of her heartbeat tickled my ear.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>I was much too young to understand the dynamics of my parents&#x2019; relationship&#x2014;that my mother was running for her life after he&#x2019;d lost his temper one too many times and hit her. Nor did I understand that my father was violating my mother&#x2019;s wishes and scaring her half to death by dropping by unannounced and demanding time with me; all I knew was that my father was at the door and he wanted to play, that he would once again, as he always did, sprinkle magic on what would have been an average day. Try as she might and despite my aunt&#x2019;s pleas not to open the door, my mother couldn&#x2019;t ignore the scene Dad was making, the banging and screaming. He even left and came back with a police officer, someone my father, who was working as a cop at the time, knew on the force. To placate him and keep my aunt, I&#x2019;m sure, from becoming the laughingstock of the neighborhood, my mother finally, slowly walked to the front door, with me in her arms. &#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she said, seething, &#x201c;you have got to stop it with all this noise. Please! You can see her for a few minutes, but then you have to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad, burly and strapping, standing at well over six feet tall, didn&#x2019;t give my mother a chance to put me in his arms; he snatched me and took off running into the winter chill, me dressed in nothing but those pajamas. Nothing could stop him&#x2014;not my mother&#x2019;s screams, not the neighbors peering out their front doors and rushing down their driveways to get a glimpse of the Negro theater unfolding on the street, not threats from his fellow officer, who&#x2019;d pointed his gun and considered shooting my father. Definitely not common sense. Where, after all, was he going to go? His home situation was sketchy, his money was funny, and really, the chance of him taking proper care of a four-year-old was slim to nil. Yet none of that mattered. He wanted to be with his daughter.<br> <br>I thought we were about to go on one of the many fun and funny adventures we always embarked on together, whether that was going for a ride on his motorcycle or taking a walk in the park; never once did it cross my four-year-old mind that something was wrong&#x2014;that we were like Bonnie and Clyde on the run. When Dad took off down the street, I wasn&#x2019;t scared; I was happy to be in his arms, so strong and thick and grand.<br> <br>My father&#x2019;s getaway was short lived, though. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to call the cops on your ass!&#x201d; my mother yelled down the street after him as she and the police officer jumped in his cruiser. From the front seat of that cop car, my mother searched frantically for me and my father for hours, unaware that he&#x2019;d stolen me away to a friend&#x2019;s house somewhere in the same neighborhood. It was my dad&#x2019;s friend who convinced him to let go of all that passion and make way for common sense: there was no way he&#x2019;d be able to get away with stealing his daughter from his wife and he finally acknowledged that. Grudgingly, he brought me back to my pleading mother&#x2019;s waiting arms. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come see you another time, baby girl,&#x201d; Dad said as my mother rushed away from him. &#x201c;I love you. Daddy loves you. Don&#x2019;t you ever forget that.&#x201d;<br> <br>What he did was wrong&#x2014;I can see that now as an adult. Still I hold tight to my belief that at that time, my father was a good guy who simply wasn&#x2019;t very diplomatic about his wants and needs versus his rights, and a tad immature when it came to understanding how to get what he wanted from others. My mother was the one who would try to reason with him; she&#x2019;d tell him time and again, &#x201c;If you want full custody of your daughter, go to court and say, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m her dad and I deserve rights, too.&#x2019; But you don&#x2019;t come knock on the door and run off in the wind with our daughter, because that&#x2019;s not going to work. Get it together and we can talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>As an adult, when I think of my parents&#x2019; polar opposite personalities, I say to myself, how in the hell did they ever meet? She&#x2019;s quiet, thoughtful, methodical. He was loud and full of drama, quick to say and do the first thing to come to mind. He wasn&#x2019;t trying to hurt anybody; it&#x2019;s not as if he were robbing banks or knocking people upside the head and taking what was theirs. Quite the contrary: he was a Vietnam vet and an artist at heart, and when his finances were flush, he made good money as a metal fabricator, installing metal bars on the windows of houses throughout the metro DC area. But my father also was a victim of the lack of support provided for Vietnam vets who served their country, only to come home to a nation still reeling from political and racial turmoil, to say nothing of that shady Reaganomics math; the only thing that trickled down to him during the Reagan administration was a decrease in the lucrative contracts that sustained him financially. No one could afford window bars and fancy iron fences and front doors anymore, and when the middle class didn&#x2019;t have money, Dad didn&#x2019;t have money. Soon enough, the checks stopped coming and he couldn&#x2019;t pay the rent, at which point the entirety of his apartment was dumped out onto the street. Getting another job to keep a roof over his head was near impossible, as he had a record&#x2014;a knot of misdemeanors he&#x2019;d gotten for a couple of street fights made it difficult for him to secure a gig that would give him enough cash to live on. With no job, no money, and nowhere to go, he ended up living in the green van he was driving at the time.<br> <br>Boris Henson was a lot of things, and he did a lot of things wrong, but he was a stand-up guy&#x2014;a good guy who was dealing with the cards life dealt him, plenty of which would have ruined a lesser man. But what he chose to do with those hands is where the best life lessons for me lay. Rather than fold into a ball and disappear from my world, he turned all that ugly upside down and let me examine its underbelly. It was important to him that I see it all&#x2014;the good and the tragic, the long, slow climb he made toward finding peace for himself&#x2014;which he ultimately did when he got sober and found Jesus&#x2014;and the pitfalls that threatened to swallow him whole along the way.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about that,&#x201d; he said of all the furniture and personal items he had to leave behind when he was evicted and living in his car. He cupped my face and looked me in my eyes. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s material stuff I can get back. I&#x2019;m alive. I&#x2019;m free.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>I&#x2019;m free. That&#x2019;s what mattered to him. And that&#x2019;s what mattered to me. There was so much emotional intelligence there, so many lessons for me to mine for my own life journey. Through example, he showed me that we&#x2019;re human&#x2014;that nobody is perfect and there most certainly isn&#x2019;t a rulebook for living a perfect life. I was to train my eyes not on the misfortune, setbacks, or possibility of failure, but on living&#x2014;really living&#x2014;without fear. Time and again, my father would show me that no matter how often he fell from grace, he simply would not let the dread and anxiety of another failure shackle him. And how could he? He needed both of his hands free so that he could place them squarely on my back and push me forward past the fear.<br> <br>The pushing started early, and my father showed no mercy, like the time he forced me to sink or swim, literally. His family, who generously arranged for me to attend all kinds of extracurricular activities my mother couldn&#x2019;t afford now that she was a single mom, paid for my swim lessons at an exclusive club in Capitol Hill, which might as well have been another world from the part of DC I called home. Every weekend, my mother would style my hair so pretty in little cornrows and dress me up in a cute bikini with an outfit and barrettes to match. Prancing, I&#x2019;d kiss my mother good-bye, and while she walked over to the cordoned area behind the glass where the parents sat, I&#x2019;d walk just as nice through the gym and out to the pool, as if I were eager to jump in the water. Then, as soon as I got to the pool, I&#x2019;d take off running and screaming around the deck like somebody was trying to kill me. Terrified that I&#x2019;d end up at the bottom of that sea of blue and chlorine, stuck like a brick to the pool floor, gasping and thrashing for air, I did not want to get in that water. Rather than toss myself into that liquid grave, I ran. Fast. So no one could catch me and force me into the pool. I was manipulative and slick&#x2014;dramatic for no reason and drunk off the attention I got when I refused to listen to the swim teacher and instead employed my devil-may-care, run-like-the-white-girl-in-a-horror-movie antics. &#x201c;Come on, sweetheart, just put your feet in the water,&#x201d; the instructor would insist every week as the rest of the class piled into the pool excitedly and I stood on the side, my arms folded, my brow furled, and my lip poked out. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to get all the way in just yet, but I want you to get used to the water. I won&#x2019;t let you go under, I promise. We&#x2019;ll take it slow.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d take a step or two toward the pool, close enough for the teacher and her charges to think that maybe this week, I&#x2019;d at least let the cool water hit my big toe. But I wasn&#x2019;t about to let that happen. Off I&#x2019;d go, running. Dramatic, just like my father.<br> <br>Every lesson, week in and week out, my mother would be completely embarrassed by my antics, and no amount of threatening or bribing could convince me to act any other way. Until, at her wits&#x2019; end, my mother, unbeknownst to me, hipped my father to my game.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m at my next lesson, running and screaming around the pool, and who comes through the double glass pool doors but none other than Boris Lawrence Henson. I had just about finished my first lap around the perimeter of the pool when he walked in, practically in slow motion, looking like Shaft 2.0 in a leather trench coat and hat, fly as hell, mean mugging like he was about to get that work. He snatched me up by my arm, bent down, looked me dead in the eye, and let me have it. &#x201c;You gonna sink or swim, do or die, but what you not gonna do is run around here acting crazy like somebody killing you.&#x201d; And then he did the unthinkable: he picked me up and tossed me into the water.<br> <br>The water stopped splashing, every tongue fell silent, everybody froze in horror. This was not the place where you show up looking like a black superhero and then throw your daughter in the pool like &#x201c;The Mack.&#x201d; But my father didn&#x2019;t give a damn. He zeroed right in on my drama. &#x201c;Uh-huh, stay your ass in that water, too!&#x201d; he yelled, jabbing his finger in my direction. &#x201c;Your mother ain&#x2019;t driving you down here just for you to act like a little monkey!&#x201d;<br> <br>And when I hit that ice-cold water and it came splashing up all around my neck and eyes and nose and cornrows, what did Taraji Penda Henson learn to do that day?<br> <br>Swim.<br> <br>My dad saw all through my foolishness, latched on to my fear, and pulled it out of me. He was the muscle&#x2014;the parent who, with one look, one curl of the lip, one phone call from my mother, could get me together and ensure I was on my best behavior and being brave. All my mother had to do was halfway say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to call your father,&#x201d; and I&#x2019;d see the light.<br> <br>Thing is, my father never put his hands on me; he didn&#x2019;t have to. He simply knew how to bring out the best in me in a way that inspired me to expect the best out of myself. He managed this not so much by being strict but more so by trusting me, by encouraging me to trust myself. This was a recurring lesson that started as early as age seven, when my father started teaching me how to drive. I&#x2019;d sit on his lap and steer his...</p><h2>Late Child</h2><p>In an effort to recover from the loss of a daughter, Vegas showgirl Harmony leaves town with her son and travels throughout the country with a dog named Iggy Pop before returning to her family home in Oklahoma. 100,000 first printing. $100,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Larry McMurtry is the author of twenty-nine novels, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Lonesome Dove</i>, three memoirs, two collections of essays, and more than thirty screenplays. He lives in Archer City, Texas.McMurtry's bittersweet 19th novel marks the welcome return of Harmony, the naively optimistic showgirl from The Desert Rose (1983). Now 47, Harmony is working in a Las Vegas recycling plant, retired from her reign as the most beautiful showgirl ever seen on the Strip (she dated Elvis and Sinatra, but slept only with Dan Duryea). Harmony's relentlessly hopeful take on life is shattered when she receives a letter from New York City explaining that her dancer daughter, Pepper, has died of AIDS. Not even the arrival of her sisters, Neddie and Pat (the latter a veteran of three trips to Masters and Johnson for sex addiction) can ease her overwhelming anguish. Fearing that grief might literally drive her insane, Harmony packs all her possessions into a U-Haul and, with her sisters and her precocious five-year-old son, Eddie, begins the drive home to Tarwater, Okla. Along the way, Eddie rescues an abandoned dog?whom they christen "Iggy Pop"?from a Hopi reservation, and the U-Haul is destroyed in a fall into the Canyon de Chelly. This necessitates a detour to New York City, where the group is carried off to the seedy No-Tel Motel in Jersey City by three Arab-immigrant hustlers. They meet Pepper's female lover, temporarily adopt a homeless teenage hooker and visit the Statue of Liberty, where Iggy Pop survives disaster with a seagull and makes the cover of People magazine. When Harmony finally makes her way to Tarwater, she finds her family laden with troubles so perilous she must turn her grief to strength if she's to save them and herself. Raucous, unexpected and downright quirky, this is McMurtry at his powerful best.

Though the schools&#x2019; autumn term was well under way, plenty of tourists unencumbered by children still came to Cornwall. After yesterday&#x2019;s drizzle, today they were being rewarded with a day as bright and warm as summer. Even the usual cool sea breeze had stilled.<br>On the other side of the narrow street, a couple were coming out of the bakery, which stayed open at lunchtime till the end of September. The man carried a brown paper bag with twisted corners. He opened it and sniffed, whereupon the woman took it from him and firmly rolled the top. Hot pasties, Eleanor guessed. The couple turned down the hill, no doubt making for one of the benches overlooking the harbour.<br>&#x201c;<i>Wuff,</i>&#x201d; Teazle reminded her.<br>She transferred the piece of sausage to the dog bowl. As she straightened after putting the bowl on the floor, the phone rang. A few steps took her across the sitting room to her desk by the window at the back of the cottage. She picked up the receiver and gave her number.<br>&#x201c;Aunt Nell, it&#x2019;s Megan. It&#x2019;s such a gorgeous day, if you&#x2019;re taking Teazle for a walk, I&#x2019;d like to join you. I didn&#x2019;t get to bed till three&#x2014;we just wrapped up a big burglary case&#x2014;and if I don&#x2019;t get out, I&#x2019;ll doze all afternoon and not sleep tonight.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course, dear. Shall I drive over to Launceston and pick you up?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, that&#x2019;s all right. You won&#x2019;t believe this, but the DI has not only given me the afternoon off, he&#x2019;s said I can take a CaRaDoC car&#x2014;plain, not a panda&#x2014;in case he has to call me back unexpectedly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Mr. Scumble?&#x201d; Eleanor, though in general inclined to believe the best of people, had clashed more than once with the detective inspector and mistrusted his apparent benevolence. &#x201c;Are you sure you didn&#x2019;t misunderstand him?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure. He said I looked peaky.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That sounds more like him, managing to combine an insult with a favour. Are you not feeling well, dear?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, just a bit tired. We&#x2019;ve been working long hours for a couple of weeks. I&#x2019;ll be over in about an hour, if that&#x2019;s all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you meet us at Rocky Valley? Nick wants to do some sketching and photographing there, and I promised to take him this afternoon. It&#x2019;s a lovely place to walk.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nick Gresham? I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly, Megan. It&#x2019;s months since he was arrested and he doesn&#x2019;t hold it against you. He&#x2019;s my next-door neighbour, you can&#x2019;t avoid him forever.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve managed pretty well so far! It&#x2019;s very embarrassing when you&#x2019;ve had to question someone about his&nbsp;... personal life. Oh, all right, I&#x2019;ll be there. It&#x2019;s between Tintagel and Boscastle, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, dear. There&#x2019;s a lay-by on the east side of the coast road. Or it might be the south side at that point, come to think of it. Never mind&#x2014;It&#x2019;s just on a sharp bend, and there&#x2019;s a footpath sign on the sea side. We&#x2019;ll see you in an hour or so.&#x201d;<br>Eleanor was glad Megan had agreed to come but disappointed by her reluctance. She was very fond of Nick and her niece. They were both about thirty, the perfect age for settling down, and both free of romantic entanglements. What could be more natural than that they should become fond of each other? Unfortunately, the artist and the detective sergeant rarely saw eye to eye. Eleanor sighed.<br>Teazle, having heard the magic word &#x201c;walk,&#x201d; was waiting impatiently by the door. Now she cocked her head, whining. Eleanor heard footsteps running up the stairs, followed by a knock.<br>&#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; she called.<br>The door opened. &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; said Nick as Teazle&#x2019;s back paws danced on her bare, sandalled feet. &#x201c;Down, girl.&#x201d; She rolled over on her back and he crouched to pet her tummy, his long brown ponytail flopping over his shoulder. The sleeves of his blue shirt were rolled up above the elbow. The shirt was spotless, but a splotch of turquoise paint on his arm had eluded him. &#x201c;Ready to go, Eleanor? Shall I go and get the Incorruptible?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, dear, would you?&#x201d; Eleanor&#x2019;s pea-green Morris Minor (named after Robespierre, the &#x201c;sea-green Incorruptible&#x201d;) lived at the bottom of the hill, in a shed she rented on the only flat piece of ground in Port Mabyn. The one and only street was too narrow for parking. &#x201c;The keys are on the hook&#x2014;oh, no, they&#x2019;re not. In my handbag? No, they must be in a pocket. What was I wearing last time I took the car out?&#x201d;<br>Nick grinned. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, but it hasn&#x2019;t been this warm and dry for a couple of weeks, so try your coat pockets.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you taking a mac? The sun may be shining now, but it is September, after all, and you never can tell.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My anorak&#x2019;s in my satchel.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Here are the keys. But there&#x2019;s no hurry. Megan&#x2019;s going to meet us there in about an hour.&#x201d;<br>He raised his eyebrows. &#x201c;Detective Sergeant Pencarrow intends to grace us with her presence? I was under the impression that I&#x2019;m out of favour. You did tell her I&#x2019;ll be there, didn&#x2019;t you, Eleanor?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course. It&#x2019;s not that she dislikes you, Nick.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;She just disapproves.&#x201d; He laughed. &#x201c;Well, I like your niece, but not enough to be shorn like a copper. As for keeping my clothes and my person paint-free, it&#x2019;s just not possible. If it&#x2019;s all right with you, I&#x2019;d like to get going. I want to reach the inlet while the sun&#x2019;s still high. You could let me out and go begging in Bossiney or Boscastle till it&#x2019;s time to meet Megan.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Requesting donations for LonStar is not begging,&#x201d; Eleanor said severely. The London Committee to Save the Starving had employed her for decades as a roving ambassador, travelling all over the world. After retiring to Cornwall, she had dedicated her ground floor to a charity shop and now spent much of her time travelling the countryside, picking up donated goods to sell. &#x201c;As a matter of fact, I did miss a couple of farms last time I was up that way. I&#x2019;ll change my shoes while you fetch the car.&#x201d;<br>Nick departed, his long legs making short work of the stairs.<br>The Incorruptible&#x2019;s aged engine did not make short work of the hill out of Port Mabyn. It groaned upward, past the newsagent&#x2019;s and Chin&#x2019;s Chinese, the Trelawny Arms and the minisupermarket, then between hedge-banks bright with ragwort and garlanded with red and orange bryony berries and the white fluff of old-man&#x2019;s beard. This stretch of coast was all cliffs, two or three hundred feet high. The lanes wound about some distance inland, so that for the most part the sea was invisible.<br>Directed by Eleanor, who knew the maze of lanes like the back of her hand, Nick left the B road and drove through tiny hamlets, Bothiwick, Trewarmett, then cut across country to avoid Tintagel, where the street was often a tourist traffic jam. At one point, a stretch of higher, open land allowed occasional glimpses of a dark blue line of sea meeting the pale blue of the sky on the far horizon.<br>Beyond the small village of Bossiney, the road wiggled through a patch of woodland. The dark green footpath sign was easy to miss, but Nick spotted it. They pulled over and he got out. Teazle was about to jump out after him, but as she scrabbled over the gear lever from the backseat, Eleanor grabbed the end of the lead. Not that there was much traffic, but cars tended to come much too fast round the blind corner.<br>&#x201c;She can come with me,&#x201d; Nick offered. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s not much mischief she can get into, and you won&#x2019;t be long, will you?&#x201d;<br>Eleanor checked her watch. &#x201c;About half an hour. All right. You behave yourself, Teazle.&#x201d; She handed over the lead to Nick and told him, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let her off till you&#x2019;re away from the road.&#x201d; She went round to the driver&#x2019;s seat and drove on.<br>The first farm she called at offered a couple of old wooden cart wheels with iron rims. The farmer&#x2019;s wife said her husband had found them at the back of the hayloft in the barn. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine why or when someone had lugged them up there. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen such set up roundabout furriners&#x2019; houses,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;so I thought you might be able to sell &#x2019;em. They&#x2019;re no earthly use to us.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lovely,&#x201d; said Eleanor. &#x201c;People like to make garden fences with them. We get a good price once they&#x2019;re cleaned up and polished.&#x201d; Jocelyn, the vicar&#x2019;s wife who ran the shop, could be counted on to turn the battered, grimy wheels into decorative &#x201c;antiques.&#x201d;<br>They wouldn&#x2019;t fit in the boot. The farmer had to be called to manoeuvre them into the backseat. As she hurried&#x2014;insofar as the car was capable of hurrying&#x2014;back towards Rocky Valley, Eleanor pictured Teazle sitting in among the spokes on the way home and she laughed.<br>She parked in the lay-by opposite the footpath, no more than a gravelled widening of the road. A moment later, a dark grey plainclothes police Mini stopped nose to nose with the Incorruptible.<br>&#x201c;Nick decided not to come?&#x201d; Did Megan soun...</p><h2>The Community Needs Assessment Workbook</h2><p>In planning community and social services, perceptions of need come from many sources from the local news to political interest groups but the first step in conducting efficient and effective community interventions is to look beyond perceptions and identify the actual needs based on available evidence.

In this eagerly anticipated new volume, the author of the National Book Award winner <i>Freedom in the Making of Western Culture</i> presents a comprehensive exploration of contemporary interethnic relations.Americans are in the midst of a rejuvenated conversation about race. How we talk about race or fail to is one of the central themes of this book, which is certain to spark lively debate among intellectuals and policy advocates.Unflinching in his analysis, Patterson chides professional race advocates, the mainstream media, and his fellow academics for homogenizing the 33 million Americans of African ancestry into a single group beset by crises and intractable dilemmas. His willingness to challenge the received wisdom of conservatives, liberals, and genetic determinists alike affords us the opportunity to critically examine our own preconceived notions and prejudices.An experienced policy advisor, Patterson brings to the national discussion a lifetime of study of slavery, freedom, and ethnic inequality worldwide. His practical recommendations emphasize solutions to problems too often described as unsolvable. For the one-fourth of the Afro-American population at the bottom rung of the socioeconomic ladder, his suggestions include housing vouchers, limiting the influx of low-skilled immigrants, and instituting a highly original policy to reduce teenage childbearing. He remains firmly committed to school desegregation, supports intermarriage as a means of promoting full integration, and takes American religious leaders to task for the &#x201d;scandal of segregation&#x201d; within their churches. Responding to widespread antagonism toward affirmative action, Patterson advocates retaining it for another fifteen years, eventually replacing it with a class-based policy.Standing as a challenge to those who insist on dwelling on the failures of race relations, <i>The Ordeal of Integration</i> admonishes Americans to stop exaggerating the intractability of persistent ethnic problems and start focusing on what <i>works.</i></p><p>A professor at Harvard, Orlando Patterson has been called a radical by conservatives and a conservative by radicals. His tendency, he notes in his introduction, is "not to care where my ideas originated--as long as they strike me as sound--or where the chips fall as a result of what I write or say." <i>The Ordeal of Integration</i> is what Patterson calls a work of economic sociology. He looks at the "remarkable facts of" black progress, refuting the notion that black America is in dire crisis. He then considers how liberals, conservatives, and those who espouse the "hereditarian or genetic" view discuss race in the United States. Throughout, Patterson calls for a return to common sense in discussions of race.<b>Orlando Patterson</b> is the John Cowles Professor of Sociology at Harvard University.</p><h2>Period.: A Girl&#39;s Guide</h2><p>For parents who do not know how or where to begin this discussion, here are ideas to get them started.

She is a mother, author, and lecturer. She has authored books, chapters, anthologies and articles on topics of sexuality and self-esteem. Her lecturing has taken her all over the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe.<br> Bonnie Worthen previously worked as a facilitator in women's sexuality groups. She and her husband are currently living in Spain. She is the mother of two adult children.<br> (JoAnn Gardner-Loulan and Bonnie Lopez Worthen are two of the three original authors.)<br> Diagram illustrations are by Marcia Quakenbush&#x2014;the original illustrator and one of the original authors. The new line drawings are by Chris Wold Dyrud of Minneapolis, MN.<br>Gr. 5-7. The most obvious change in this revised edition (originally published in 1979 by Volcano Press) is the artwork. The design and the black-and-white line drawings, this time by Chris Wold Dyrud and Marcia Quackenbush, are far more appealing than those in the earlier book. The organization is also much better, with clear subheads setting up answers to questions about such basic, very practical matters as "What do I do when I get my period for the first time?" and "What kind of exercise can I do?" The text has undergone a few changes, too (there's acknowledgement of PMS, for example), though much is the same in its coverage of topics ranging from tampons and cramps to a pelvic exam. New to this edition are a calendar for photocopying and an index (awkwardly positioned before the helpful guide for parents). Unlike Robie Harris' <i>It's Perfectly Normal</i> (1994), the focus here is strictly on menstruation; this is not a book about puberty or an introduction to sexuality. But it's a warmly encouraging book, that tells it like it is for young girls. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For every recognizable item included, there are plenty of others guaranteed to confuse or interest&nbsp; 21st century readers&#x2014;like Bust Cream or Food and Sweet Spirits of Nitre. What was once standard household fare is today a sometimes strange, often funny look at what life was once like for the average American family.

In this book, Kevin Phillips shows how this populist explosion revealed a powerful new political force: widespread frustration over the decline of middle-class prosperity and the threat to the American dream.<br>Teenage homelessness in the Chicago suburbs ... crumpled home values in Southern California ... the worst job market for college graduates in New York City since the Great Depression: It all added up to the sharpest economic decline in decades, provoking political unrest unequaled in sixty years. There had been declines before, but no previous postwar downturn so damaged the white middle class as a whole or raised such fears that Americans might lose the unique economic privileges that they have enjoyed since World War II. Boiling Point shows in dismaying detail what has happened to the middle class since the 1970s in disposable income, earnings, home values, job prospects, public services, assets and net worth, pension safety and health insurance, and the next generation's prospects of enjoying the same rising living standards and upward mobility as its parents had. And it was not a natural result of adverse global trends but of deliberate political choices.<br>In the Reagan-Bush years American leaders who had once spoken up for the average family were celebrating investors, speculators, and the rich, shifting the burden of taxes from the wealthy to the middle class while starving public services and disregarding the growing debt that would punish future generations.<br>The populist anger so vivid in 1992 is not a onetime phenomenon. It will persist, Phillips says, until the middle class resumes the road to prosperity under government policies that it considers fair. It is on this that the politics of the 1990s now depends.</p><p>From the bestselling author of <i>The Politics of Rich and Poor</i>, a scholarly examination of the steady decline of America's middle class--the book President Clinton singled out as the source that should help him solve the middle-class dilemma.Phillips's hard-hitting analysis of the middle-class decline in the U.S. is a worthy sequel to The Politics of Rich and Poor , in which he predicted a populist revolt against Reagan-Bush policies that favored the rich. Here the onetime Republican campaign strategist spells out in painstaking detail how the Reagan-Bush agenda benefited the nation's wealthiest 1% at the expense of a middle class battered by inequitable taxes, deteriorating public services, increasingly unaffordable health care and education, shrinking employee benefits, job cutbacks and declining household net worth. Clinton tapped middle-class frustration using populist rhetoric, but unless his administration delivers on its promises to the eroding middle class while revitalizing the economy, the Democrats will be voted out of office in 1996, suggests Phillips. He stresses that the Democrats must replace yesteryear's internationalism with greater emphasis on domestic issues and must curb the abuses sponsored by financial elites and welfare statists alike.

He traces the development of this element of the American heritage from its beginning as a literal interpretation of biblical prophecies. Pointing to the application of the millenarian ideal to successive stages of American history, notably apocalyptic events like the Civil War, Tuveson illustrates its pervasive cultural influences with examples from the writings of Jonathan Edwards, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Timothy Dwight, and Julia Ward Howe, among others.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder</h2><p>Famed Charles Manson prosecutor and three time #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Vincent Bugliosi has written the most powerful, explosive, and thought-provoking book of his storied career.<p>In <i>The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder</i>, Bugliosi presents a tight, meticulously researched legal case that puts George W. Bush on trial in an American courtroom for the murder of nearly 4,000 American soldiers fighting the war in Iraq. Bugliosi sets forth the legal architecture and incontrovertible evidence that President Bush took this nation to war in Iraq under false pretenses&#x2014;a war that has not only caused the deaths of American soldiers but also over 100,000 innocent Iraqi men, women, and children; cost the United States over one trillion dollars thus far with no end in sight; and alienated many American allies in the Western world.</p><p>As a prosecutor who is dedicated to seeking justice, Bugliosi, in his inimitable style, delivers a non-partisan argument, free from party lines and instead based upon hard facts and pure objectivity.</p><p>A searing indictment of the President and his administration, <i>The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder</i> also outlines a legally credible pathway to holding our highest government officials accountable for their actions, thereby creating a framework for future occupants of the oval office.</p><p>Vincent Bugliosi calls for the United States of America to return to the great nation it once was and can be again. He believes the first step to achieving this goal is to bring those responsible for the war in Iraq to justice.</p></p><p><b>Vincent Bugliosi</b> received his law degree in 1964. In his career at the L.A. County District Attorney&#x2019;s office, he successfully prosecuted 105 out of 106 felony jury trials, including 21 murder convictions without a single loss. His most famous trial, the Charles Manson case, became the basis of his classic, <i>Helter Skelter</i>, the biggest selling true-crime book in publishing history. Two of Bugliosi&#x2019;s other books&#x2014;<i>And the Sea Will Tell</i> and<i>Outrage</i>&#x2014;also reached #1 on the <i>New York Times</i> hardcover bestseller list. No other American true-crime writer has ever had more than one book that achieved this ranking. His latest book,<i>Reclaiming History: The Assassination of President John F. Kennedy</i>, has been heralded as &#x201c;epic&#x201d; and &#x201c;a book for the ages.&#x201d;<p>Bugliosi has uncommonly attained success in two separate and distinct fields, as an author and a lawyer. His excellence as a trial lawyer is best captured in the judgment of his peers. &#x201c;Bugliosi is as good a prosecutor as there ever was,&#x201d; Alan Dershowitz says. F. Lee Bailey calls Bugliosi &#x201c;the quintessential prosecutor.&#x201d; &#x201c;There is only one Vince Bugliosi. He&#x2019;s the best,&#x201d; says Robert Tanenbaum, for years the top homicide prosecutor in the Manhattan D.A.&#x2019;s office. Most telling is the comment by Gerry Spence, who squared off against Bugliosi in a twenty-one-hour televised, scriptless &#x201c;docu-trial&#x201d; of Lee Harvey Oswald, in which the original key witnesses to the Kennedy assassination testified and were cross-examined. After the Dallas jury returned a guilty verdict in Bugliosi&#x2019;s favor, Spence said, &#x201c;No other lawyer in America could have done what Vince did in this case.&#x201d;</p><p>Bugliosi lives with his wife, Gail, in Los Angeles.</p>The Charles Manson prosecutor and author proposes trying George W. Bush for murder. He cites the evidence in detail and discusses the legal issues in a reasoned analysis that does not conceal his anger at our 43rd President. Bugliosi himself narrates for the first half-hour, and his tone of unrestrained petulance makes the listening painful. Narrator Marc Cashman then takes over, using an objective tone more appropriate for tender ears. Cashman&#39;s imitation of Bush&#39;s speech mannerisms when he is delivering quotes may bring the only moments of humor to the production. Using a normal voice for all other quotations, Cashman says &#34;quote&#34; and &#34;unquote&#34; before and after each. Because there are hundreds of quotes, this repetition becomes a distraction.

She sat herself down on one of the stiff little chairs arranged round the table in its centre and wished that she hadn't come. The advertisement had sought a girl Friday. This term could cover anything from washing up in the kitchen to dealing with invitations on beautifully engraved cards and paying the household bills with an odd spell of babysitting when called upon. It was not what she would have chosen if given a choice, but a job and the wages which went with it had become essential.<br><br>The butler returned and frostily requested her to follow him. Crossing the hall and mounting the stairs behind him, Franny reflected that she could always refuse to take the job if she was offered it. She thrust the thought aside; common sense reminded her that she needed work.<br><br>'The young person,' said the butler, opening the double doors at the head of the stairs. Franny sailed past him. She was of medium height, rather too thin, with brown hair and ordinary features easily forgotten, but she had an air of composed dignity.<br><br>'My name is Francesca Bowen,' she said clearly, and advanced towards the occupant of the room. This was a forbidding lady if ever there was one; she was handsome, middle-aged, with rigidly controlled grey hair and a haughty nose. She looked down it now.<br><br>She gave Franny a regal nod. 'You appear very young.'<br><br>'I'm twenty-three, Lady Trumper.'<br><br>Lady Trumper hadn't expected to be answered; she looked her surprise and leafed through some letters she was holding.<br><br>'You have trained for two years as a nurse. Why did you not continue?'<br><br>'I left to look after my aunt and my brother. My aunt was ill at the time.'<br><br>'I do not require a nurse.'<br><br>'Well, I didn't suppose you did,' said Franny cheerfully, 'but you never know, it might come in useful. I can type and keep accounts, answer the phone, walk the dog, babysit..' She paused. 'I'm not a very good cook.'<br><br>'I have a cook, Miss Bowen. Nor do I require a babysitter. I am afraid that you are not suitable for the post I have in mind.'<br><br>Lady Trumper stretched out a hand and touched a bell, and the butler opened the door so quickly Franny decided that he had been standing outside listening. He preceded her down the hall with an I-told-you-so look on his face, and was on the point of ushering her out into the street when an elderly woman in a large white apron rushed into the hall.<br><br>'Mr Barker&#x2014; Oh, Mr Barker, come quickly. Elsie's cut her hand that bad; she's bleeding like a pig and screaming her head off. Whatever shall I do?'<br><br>Barker said with dignity, 'I will come and see Elsie, Mrs Down, it is probably nothing more than a slight wound.'<br><br>He followed her through the baize door at the back of the hall and Franny, unnoticed for the moment, went with them.<br><br>It wasn't a slight wound; it was a nasty deep slice in poor Elsie's forearm, bleeding profusely and no one was doing anything about it.<br><br>Franny swept forward. 'Someone get a doctor or an ambulance, whichever is quickest. Clean towels and bandages, if you have them.'<br><br>Elsie's face was the colour of ashes. Franny lifted her arm above her head, found the pressure point and applied a finger, and when Mrs Down came with the towels asked, 'Can you cover the cut with several of them and press down hard? Just for a little while until help comes.' She added cheerfully to Elsie, 'It looks much worse than it is, Elsie. As soon as the doctor has seen to it, you'll feel much better. Close your eyes if you like.' She added to no one in particular, 'I hope that man hurries up...'<br><br>Mr Barker left the kitchen briskly and made for the telephone in the hall. Like so many self-important persons, he was no good at all in an emergency and, while he resented Franny's high-handedness, he felt relief at not having to deal with the situation himself. He had his hand on the phone when the door knocker was thumped, and almost without thinking he put the phone down and opened the door.<br><br>The man who went past him into the hall was thickset and enormously tall, with fair hair going grey at the temples and a handsome visage. He said affably, 'Anything wrong, Barker? You look a bit shaken.'<br><br>Barker took his coat. 'It's Elsie, sir. Cut herself something shocking. I am about to phone for an ambulance.'<br><br>'In the kitchen, is she?' The visitor was already at the baize door. 'I'll take a quick look, shall I?'<br><br>The kitchen was modern, all white tiles and stainless steel, and the group around the table looked all the more startling because of it: Elsie, her arm still held high, Mrs Down holding a blood-stained cloth over her arm, and a girl he didn't know applying pressure with the calm air of someone who knew what she was doing.<br><br>'Oh, sir,' cried Mrs Down as he reached the table. Franny looked up briefly.<br><br>'Are you the doctor? Good! I think perhaps it's her radial artery.'<br><br>He grunted and opened his bag, and glanced at Franny. 'Hang on until I've got the tourniquet on.' That done, he said, 'Go on the other side of me and hold her arm steady.' He looked down at Elsie. 'I'll make you comfortable, Elsie, but I think you must go to hospital and have a stitch or two. It won't hurt, I promise you.'<br><br>'Shall I call an ambulance, sir?' asked Barker, almost his pompous self once more now that there was someone to tell him what to do.<br><br>'No. I'll take her. Someone will have to come with me.' His eyes fell on Franny. She was a nondescript girl, but she looked sensible. 'You'll come?'<br><br>Franny heard Barker's quick breath, but before he could speak she said, 'Yes, of course.' She added in her sensible way, 'Elsie will need a coat or a shawl; it's cold outside.'<br><br>An old cloak was found from behind the kitchen door and Mrs Down stood with it on her arm, looking the other way while Elsie's artery was tied off. It all took some time, what with the scrubbing of hands and the giving of a local anaesthetic into Elsie's arm. Franny, who had worked in Theatre, considered the man to be a very neat surgeon.<br><br>When the arm had been bandaged and put in a sling, and Elsie wrapped in the cloak, Franny went without fuss out of the house, walking sedately behind the doctor who was carrying Elsie.<br><br>Elsie was still feeling faint, and Franny got into the back of the car with her. She put her arm round her, reflecting that she had never expected to have the chance to travel in a Rolls-Royce. It was a pity she wasn't able to enjoy it to the full, but with Elsie shaking and sobbing it hardly seemed right to get any pleasure from it...<br><br>It was already dusk, and the chilly November day was sliding rapidly into a miserable evening. She wouldn't have to stay at the hospital, of course, but getting back home during the evening rush hour would be tedious.<br><br>They drew up outside the entrance to Casualty and the doctor got out and went inside. He returned almost immediately with a porter and a wheelchair, followed by a doctor and then a nurse. He seemed well known, thought Franny, standing quietly as Elsie was wheeled away. Everyone went with her and Franny stood undecided for a few minutes.<br><br>If the doctor had wanted her to go with him too and to stay he would have said so. Elsie was in safe hands now; Franny had no doubt that she would be kept in the hospital for the night. She turned on her heel and started for the nearest bus stop. She would have liked to have seen more of the doctor. They had hardly exchanged more than half a dozen words and she doubted very much if he would recognise her if ever they should meet again.<br><br>Franny joined the bus-stop queue and waited to begin her long journey home.<br><br>It was half an hour before Professor Marc van der Kettener came out to his car. It wasn't until he was getting into it that he remembered Franny. He went back into the hospital again to look for her, but it was quickly obvious that she hadn't waited, and he cursed himself for a thoughtless fool. She had been helpful and she hadn't fussed or asked silly questions. Why had she been at his godmother's house, anyway?<br><br>He drove himself back there, assured Barker that Elsie was quite comfortable and would be staying in hospital for a couple of days and went upstairs to see his godmother.<br><br>She offered a cheek for his kiss when he entered her quarters. 'What is all this I hear from Barker? That silly girl cutting herself.'<br><br>'I hardly think that Elsie cut herself deliberately.' The professor wandered across the room and sat down opposite Lady Trumper. 'She has quite a severe injury; she should do nothing for a week and then only light work.'<br><br>'How tiresome. I suppose Barker coped?'<br><br>'I'm sure he did his best. Fortunately, there was a young woman in the kitchen who dealt with the situation in a most sensible manner.' He glanced across at his godmother. 'A new maid?'<br><br>'Certainly not.' Lady Trumper frowned. 'Presumably Barker knew who she was?'<br><br>The professor smiled. 'Well, she was giving him orders in a brisk manner. She was brisk with me, too.'<br><br>'What was she like? Perhaps it was Mrs Down's sister.'<br><br>'Young, nice voice&#x2014;educated. For the life of me I cannot remember her face. Came with me to the hospital without fuss and took herself off while I was with Elsie. Otherwise I would have brought her back here.'<br><br>Lady Trumper rang her bell, and when Barker answered bade him come in.<br><br>'Barker, do you know the young woman who helped Elsie?'<br><br>'Yes, my lady, she was the young person who came about the post you had advertised. I was on the point of seeing her out when Mrs Down came running. I had no idea that she had accompanied me to the kitchen until she took charge.' He added, 'I trust that this does not displease you, my lady? She proved herself very competent.'<br><br>'Yes, yes, Barker. She hasn't returned?'<br><br>'No, my lady. I understood that you did not engage her.'<br><br>'Very well, Barker. Thank you.'<br><br>When he had gone, she said, 'A Miss Francesca Bowen who applied for the post of girl Friday. She didn't seem quite suitable. I shall have to look for someone else.'<br><br>'No, no, Godmother. Engage the girl. She is obviously a young woman of resources and surely that is what a girl Friday should be&#x2014;able to turn her hand to anything!'<br><br>'You are not serious, Marc?'<br><br>'Indeed, I am. Presumably she won't have found another job today. Write to her and tell her that you have decided to give her a trial.'<br><br>Lady Trumper looked doubtful. 'You really think it is a good idea? But as you say, I can have her on month's trial.'<br><br>'By all means. Write her a note; I'll post it on my way to my rooms.'<br><br>'Have you patients this evening?'<br><br>'Yes, two.' He glanced at his watch. 'I had better go shortly. I'm dining out afterwards.'<br><br>Lady Trumper had gone to the writing desk under the window and picked up a pen. 'When will you be going home?'<br><br>'In several weeks. I've patients still to see and a number of theatre lists here. I have to go to Leeds and Manchester before I go back.'<br><br>'You work too hard. Isn't it time you settled down? Your dear sister mentioned someone. She hoped that you were thinking of marrying.'<br><br>'I'm afraid she must hope!' He smiled, but something in his voice stopped her from saying more. She wrote the note and handed it to him.<br><br>'Come and see me when you have time,' she begged him. 'At least let me know when you are going back to Holland.'<br><br>He bent to kiss her. 'Of course. Take care of yourself.'<br><br>Barker was waiting for him in the hall. 'Don't allow Elsie to do any work at all for several days, Barker, and see that when she does start again she keeps that arm covered. A fortunate thing that she was given such prompt first aid.' At the door he paused. 'By the way, Lady Trumper has had second thoughts and will probably engage the young woman on a trial basis.'<br><br>'We shall do our best to welcome her into the household, sir,' said Barker pompously. He added, looking almost human, 'She behaved in a most efficient manner and made no fuss.'<br><br>The professor, his mind on other matters, nodded in an absent-minded way and bade him goodnight.<br><br>Franny got off the crowded bus and turned into a side street that was badly lighted, with small terraced houses facing each other behind narrow strips of worn-out grass and battered iron railings. The houses might be small, and had seen better days, but most of them were keeping up appearances with curtained windows and cared-for front doors. Halfway down the terrace Franny opened one such door and called out as she shut it behind her. 'It's me&#x2014;sorry I'm late.'<br><br>She hung her outdoor things in the narrow hall and went into the kitchen; it was a small, rather dark room, lacking the amenities often portrayed in magazines, but it was cheerful, with bright curtains and an old-fashioned red plush cloth on the table. There was a young man sitting there, books spread in front of him, writing. He said 'Hi,' as she went in but didn't look up. The elderly lady standing by the gas stove turned round to smile at her.<br><br>'What kept you, love? Would you like a cup of tea? Supper won't be for half an hour. How did you get on?'<br><br>Franny filled the kettle and put it on the gas burner.<br><br>'No good, Auntie, I wasn't suitable. It was a lovely house and there was a butler. While I was there one of the maids cut her arm quite badly so I stopped to give first aid, and when a doctor came he asked me to go to the hospital with the girl. So I did.'<br><br>'I hope that they thanked you.'<br><br>'Well, now I come to think of it, they didn't. The doctor was polite, but I think he took me for one of the servants.'<br><br>Mrs Blake looked indignant. 'Did he, indeed? What happened at the hospital?'<br><br>'Well, nothing. I mean, I didn't go in. I waited a bit but no one came out, so I caught a bus and came home.'<br><br>'Disgraceful. The ingratitude...' Mrs Blake, a small, plump lady with a mild face and grey hair, was ever more indignant.<br><br>'Well, it doesn't matter,' said Franny cheerfully. 'As we passed the supermarket in the bus I saw a notice in the window asking for check-out girls. I'll go tomorrow.'<br><br>Mrs Blake started to speak, and stopped. The gas bill had come that morning, Finlay needed more books and the rent was due. The housekeeping money was at a very low ebb and the only solution was for Franny to get a job as soon as possible.<br><br>Mrs Blake was unhappy about that. They had just about managed while Franny had been training as a nurse; her salary and Mrs Blake's pension had kept them going. They had even been saving a tiny bit, knowing that Finn would be going to medical school when he had done so well in his A levels. He would need books and clothes and money to live on.</p><h2>Animal Wisdom</h2><p>This beautifully illustrated book explores the legends, rituals, and magic surrounding 70 of our most beloved animals.</p><p>Jessica Palmer is descended from Dakota woodland Sioux.

Adams had never been to London, but he was sure that nothing in the House of Commons could be more imposing than the sight of five judges in scarlet robes and luminous white wigs, seated in front of a marble fireplace. On the wall were portraits of two former British kings, Charles II and James II, which had been sent from London years before. They had been stored in an attic until a recently installed governor of Massachusetts, Francis Bernard, had discovered them and had them cleaned and mounted in magnificent gold frames. Adams was aware that both kings were autocrats and he suspected that giving them such a place of honor showed Bernard's political bias. But he thought them beautiful, worthy of Rubens or Vandyke. </p><p> Adams had come on this overcast morning in February 1761 to see the climax to a political drama that had been unfolding for months. Normally, the day's proceedings would have been routine: a new king had recently taken the throne in England, and a document called the writ of assistance had to be approved once again by the colony's Superior Court. But the writ was in fact a general search warrant, and it represented a serious economic threat around Boston Harbor. When ships sailed past the islands in the channel and came to anchor at one of Boston's long wooden wharves, they were often smuggling illegal goods along with their legitimate cargo. Molasses was especially popular, since it could be shipped legally only from British ports. Some sixty distillers around Massachusetts turned the molasses into millions of gallons of rum each year, and the traders who supplied them bought a better quality at French and Dutch ports in the West Indies and avoided the British taxes. Over the past twenty years, Bostonians had suffered economic depressions, and they were worried now that London's attempt to enforce the customs law might set off more hard times. That would affect not only the merchants but also the men who built the ships and sailed them, the distillers and shopkeepers, the artisans who supplied silver buckles and candlesticks, even the town's hundreds of teenage apprentices in their leather aprons. </p><p> The persistent war between England and the French and their Indian allies had provided an economic boom for a few profiteers, but the peace that now seemed assured might bring inflation and greater debt. Boston's wealthiest merchants enjoyed a cushion against a depression; five hundred of the sixteen thousand residents owned nearly fifty percent of the town's assets. But one out of three adult men had no property or even a regular job, and they hung about the wharves taking whatever work they found or signing on as sailors. Some were forced to leave the capital altogether for one of the smaller communities -- Salem, Gloucester, Marble-head. </p><p> British law already gave the crown's tax collectors permission to search a ship while it lay at anchor in the bay, although few had ever been zealous about making the effort. Some of those appointed were Londoners who never bothered to come to America. Others could be bribed. Britain spent eight thousand pounds each year on salaries for the customs service and collected two thousand pounds in taxes. But the writs that were to be reauthorized were more menacing because they allowed officials to break into a man's warehouse or even his home to find contraband. Disruptions during the war with the French had prevented the writs from being widely used, but now, with Britain moving to enforce the law, merchants in Boston and Salem had responded by challenging the writs' legality and had hired two prominent lawyers to argue the case before the Massachusetts Bay Colony's highest court. </p><p> This public aspect of the dispute was what had drawn Adams to the Town House. But, like most observers, he knew there were also personal resentments that could affect the case's outcome. At the center was Thomas Hutchinson. Despite his lack of training as a lawyer, Hutchinson had been appointed by Governor Bernard three months earlier to replace the chief justice who had died. For thirty years, Massachusetts lawyers had been struggling to win respectability for their calling, and many were disgusted that their profession's highest honor had gone to a man who was reading elementary law texts at night to prepare for court. John Adams was a self-conscious young man, desperately ambitious, and he had come to the capital from the town of Braintree to make his reputation. He thought he understood why Hutchinson had been named to the high court. The previous chief justice had expressed doubts that the writs were legal. Hutchinson was known to support them. But the significance of his appointment went far beyond that. </p><p> John Adams came from an honest and hard-working but not particularly distinguished family, and he was contemptuous of the idea that a man's place in society should be determined by his lineage. And in Boston, few men represented entrenched privilege more clearly than Thomas Hutchinson. The Hutchinsons had been successful businessmen for generations, and Thomas had been brought up to be a member of Boston's ruling class, although he had to contend with problems within the family. His father suffered from nervous disorders that kept him shut up in his house for weeks and from chronic insomnia, and he had lost two favorite sons and a daughter to smallpox and consumption. </p><p> By the time Thomas Hutchinson entered Harvard College, two months before his twelfth birthday, his character was already formed. His one lapse -- he had used a Greek trot to translate a Latin lesson -- had caused his tutor to remark, <i>"A non te expectare,"</i> I did not expect it of you. Thomas would remember that rebuke for the rest of his life. He loved history best and wept at the account of Charles I's beheading. </p><p> At college, Thomas began his business career by trading several hundred pounds of fish his father had given him. By graduation, he had built that capital into nearly five hundred pounds sterling. When he married, at twenty-three, Thomas had become an imposing young man, six feet tall. His seventeen-year-old bride was the daughter of a man whose family had been the Hutchinsons' business partners for four generations. Though Thomas was normally aloof, it was a good marriage. He would remark that the intimacy he found with Peggy Hutchinson was proof that he had a soul. </p><p> Hutchinson turned naturally to public service and in 1737, at the age of twenty-six, was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, ignoring his father, who warned him, "Depend on it, if you serve your country faithfully, you will be reproached and reviled for doing it." More than Thomas cared to recognize, he had inherited the spirit of his great-great-grandmother Anne Hutchinson, who had been banished to Rhode Island in 1637 as a religious zealot. He might be temperate and rational in his religion, but in a political cause he could be stubborn to the point of foolhardiness. Hutchinson used his mastery of economics to defend Boston's aristocrats against challenges from a growing party of workers and shopkeepers. When Boston went through periods of inflation, Hutchinson antagonized much of the town by advocating hard-money policies, and in 1749 he had led a move to base the colony's currency on silver. The economic contractions that followed turned his name into a curse among the town's working people. When his house caught fire, crowds gathered, shouting, "Let it burn!" </p><p> Hutchinson remained within a close circle of family and prosperous friends. He considered it contemptible to seek a wider popularity and described the multitude as "foreign seamen, servants, Negroes and other persons of mean and vile condition." When his conservative fiscal policies cost him his seat in the House, the governor had named him to the Council, the more aristocratic upper body. Hutchinson's career was destined to continue at that higher level. He built a summer house on a hundred acres in Milton, eight miles from Boston, and visitors from abroad assured him they had never seen a finer view than the one from his hilltop. </p><p> In 1754, Peggy Hutchinson died at the end of her twelfth pregnancy. Hutchinson had always believed that religion -- like sound money -- was essential to a well-ordered society, but his faith was no consolation to him now. He buried his wife and moved to Milton with his four children and his new daughter, another Peggy, who had survived. </p><p> When Hutchinson returned to public life, he served first as an aide to the royal governor, then as his lieutenant. His ambition revived, and he fought successfully to preside over the Council. He was also a judge of probate, a justice of common pleas and governor of Castle William, the royal fortress in Boston Harbor. His hobby was collecting documents, letters and journals, and he planned to publish his version of the history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. </p><p> In Boston's many taverns, men had not forgiven Hutchinson for his consistent support of the rich and powerful and were troubled by the way he was consolidating his authority. They called him "Summa Potestatis," the supreme power, or simply "Summa." Now he had added the position of chief justice to his collection. </p><p> Hutchinson's appointment had annoyed John Adams, but it was far more disturbing to a thirty-five-year-old lawyer named James Otis. When the chief justice died in September, Otis had called on Thomas Hutchinson to ask his help in getting an appointment to the court for his father, the speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. A previous governor had promised Speaker Otis a place on the Superior Court, and the younger Otis wanted Hutchinson to use his influence with Governor Bernard to secure it. </p><p> Otis had gone to the Hutchinson mansion in Boston's North End, one of the town's most beautiful houses. Most Bostonians knew that the Hutchinson family looked down on the Otises, but James Otis, who was quick-tempered and haughty, had put aside his pride to make the call. Hutchinson, approaching fifty, was slender and fair, with the assurance of privilege. Otis was plump, with a round face and a short neck, but his eyes were keen and he exuded energy. Although he had studied law, the one book he had published was a study of Latin poetry. </p><p> Otis had put his appeal diffidently. If Mr. Hutchinson himself had any interest in serving on the high court, he would not say another word about his father. Hutchinson swore later that he had told Otis candidly that he had considered the appointment but that he wasn't sure he would accept if Bernard offered it to him. Otis had left convinced that Hutchinson had said he would turn it down. </p><p> Soon after, Otis had called directly on Governor Bernard. The town of Boston was almost an island, linked to the mainland by a narrow road called Boston Neck, and as Otis was riding his horse toward the governor's mansion he saw Thomas Hutchinson coming the other way in a carriage, apparently returning from his own audience with the governor. Then there were other disturbing portents about the appointment. Some of Boston's established merchants were openly questioning whether Speaker Otis was qualified to sit on the Superior Court. Over the years, he had done many favors for the colony's conservative governors, but his career had begun fifteen years earlier, in rougher times, when election officials sometimes reached into the hat that doubled as a ballot box and threw out all of the opposition votes. </p><p> Speaker Otis' first bill in the House had set a bounty on Indian scalps -- one hundred English pounds for males twelve years or older, fifty pounds for women. And although the Otises were an established New England family, Speaker Otis had worked as a shoemaker in his youth. Since two thirds of the members of the Massachusetts House listed "farmer" as their primary occupation, that was no disgrace, and Otis had gone on to become a prosperous lawyer. But he had always regretted his lack of a classical education and had made sure that James went to Harvard College and then to study law under Jeremiah Gridley, the colony's finest legal scholar. </p><p> Memories among Boston's aristocracy were long and unforgiving. Conservative merchants were arguing that Speaker Otis was backed by the same men they had been fighting for years -- Boston's retailers, innkeepers, others of the lower classes. Thomas Hutchinson had told friends that Otis had become speaker of the House only because he had done "little low dirty things" that no reputable person would stoop to doing. </p><p> Two months passed after James Otis' appeal to Hutchinson until, in mid-November, Governor Bernard told Hutchinson that he wanted him as chief justice. Hutchinson warned him that he might be courting trouble by disappointing the Otises, and he added that around town James Otis was threatening violence if his father was not chosen. But Bernard offered Hutchinson the job and added that whatever his answer, he did not intend to appoint Speaker Otis. </p><p> Hutchinson accepted. For years, the king's ministers in London had passed him over for the governorship, and he had served under three governors from England. It seemed unlikely that he would ever hold the highest title, although he had several consolations beyond his judgeships. As lieutenant governor, Hutchinson was already the colony's deputy executive. As president of the Council, he was its ranking legislator. Now he would hold the highest judicial post. </p><p> When he heard about the appointment, James Otis was enraged. Aside from the insult to his father, Otis believed that Hutchinson would hold two titles too many. Montesquieu's <i>The Spirit of Laws</i> had been published a dozen years earlier, and Otis had been impressed by its argument for separating the three branches of government. But now, because Otis had tried to get the post for his father, his criticism of Hutchinson's expanding power could be dismissed as coming from a disgruntled loser. And Hutchinson's friends did soon accuse Otis of making wild threats against the colony's government. They said he had vowed to set the province in flames, though he himself might perish in the fire. Everyone knew that Otis was proud of his Latin scholarship, and his antagonists clinched their charge by quoting a line from Virgil that Otis was supposed to be repeating: <i>"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo."</i> (If heaven I cannot bend, then hell I'll stir.) Otis' political allies called the allegation a lie. They said no one would become frenzied over such a trivial setback. But in Boston's small world, Otis was well known. John Adams, who was eager to learn from other men's success, had been studying Otis carefully and admired his agile mind. But he had also watched Otis' quick temper cause him to stutter and had seen Otis' muscles twitch even when he was sitting still. Everything about Otis' tense brilliance made the reports of his threats entirely plausible. </p><p> James Otis' energy and his unpredictable moods had been apparent even when he was growing up. Pressed into playing the violin for friends who wanted to dance, he had thrown it ...</p></p><h2>Fire on the Mountain</h2><p>Nanda Kaul, a woman remote in her self-imposed solitude among the Simla hills of India, her strange and silent great-granddaughter, and the broken old woman who is her only friend are touched in varying ways by the violence of living</p><p>Anita Desai was born and educated in India.

Douglas Wixson tells [Conroy&#39;s] story, and those of other writers like him, with clarity, intelligence, and impressive scholarly energy.&#34;-Charles Fanning, New York Times Book Review &#34;An exhaustively researched, felicitously written biography as well as &#39;a forum for the contributors to Conroy&#39;s magazines ... to tell their stories.&#39; We get a sense of the keen ear Conroy and other worker- writers had for the folklore, flamboyance, irony, irreverence, and resistance sometimes present in working-class vernacular... Those attempting to historicize and theorize working-class writing of the United States could find no better guide than this book. Like the legacy of Comrade Jack, Worker-Writer will endure.&#34; - Constance Coiner, The Journal of American History &#34;The general reader interested in the origins of many of America&#39;s multicultural literary traditions will find much to mine in these pages, remarkably readable for an academic study... Jack Conroy lives again in this book, brave, funny, honest, and larger than life.&#34;-Henry Kisor, Chicago Sun-Times &#34;A prodigious research effort by an obviously skilled and dedicated scholar... For serious students of twentieth-century radicalism or social history, this is a must read.&#34; - North Dakota Quarterly &#34;The author of this important work ... is one of Conroy&#39;s greatest admirers. He appreciates Conroy&#39;s wonderful body of writing, but this study also acknowledges his other contributions, including his marvelous editorial skills... Wixson served as Conroy&#39;s literary executor, which enabled him to examine a wealth of letters and manuscripts. His numerous interviews with Conroy are fascinating not only as biographical references, but as an important literary history of the American worker as shaped by the structures and circumstances of twentieth-century life. Wixson has done an excellent job and has provided a key work for a better understanding of the worker-writer in our culture.&#34; - Arthur F. McClure, Missouri Historical Review &#34;A long-overdue account of the proletarian writers&#39; movement in Depression- era America, when economic deprivation and despair politicized U.S. writers like nothing before or since... [Wixson&#39;s] book is the most significant contribution to 1930s literary history since Aaron&#39;s Writers on the Left.&#34; - David Brent Johnson, The Ryder Magazine ADVANCE PRAISE &#34;A critical but sympathetic exploration of the political and cultural milieu that produced the &#39;proletarian literature&#39; of the 1930s, a moment in American literary radicalism that has previously attracted more dismissal and ridicule than serious study. This is a fine book, which deserves to take its place on the bookshelf of every historian interested in the era, alongside the works of Daniel Aaron, Richard Pells, and Alan Wald.&#34; - Maurice Isserman &#34;A genuine breakthrough into a rich area of cultural history.&#34; - Alan Wald &#34;Important and stunningly original... Not only a fine and definitive biography of Jack Conroy but also the first detailed history of an important group of midwestern radical writers-novelists and poets-of the 1920s and 1930s. For the first time we learn the real material conditions of this literary network during the Depression. No previous work of scholarship comes close to telling this story at all, let alone in such rich detail. - Cary Nelson, author of Repression and Recovery: Modern American Poetry and the Politics of Cultural Memory &#34;An important contribution to our understanding of that literature and the histories it represents... In one sense a detailed and remarkably sympathetic biography; it is also an impressive work of cultural history, describing the actions of an extended network of Midwestern radical writers and small presses that flourished during the late 1920s and the 1930s... Wixson is especially insightful about the internal conflict experienced by many of these authors as the result of their dual status as worker and writer.&#34; - Nicholas Coles, Gateway Heritage</p><h2>American Heart Association Low-Salt Cookbook, 3rd Edition: A Complete Guide to Reducing Sodium and Fat in Your Diet</h2><p>This revised and expanded third edition of the <i>American Heart Association Low-Salt Cookbook</i> is an indispensable resource for sodium-watchers.<br><br>The statistics are in&#x2014;65 million Americans have high blood pressure, and nearly 5 million suffer from congestive heart failure.

Kymberly Dakin&#39;s vocal quality seems formal at first, but it&#39;s utterly calm and so connected to this writing that listeners almost immediately forget anyone else is reading and hear only the essence of Mary Pipher and her story. Pipher is a mature storyteller whose responses to her uneven family experiences and self-critical ways come across as uplifting rather than melodramatic or self-pitying.

Built by an eccentric owner, molded by a visionary coach and loaded with hardscrabble miners, college All Americans and the sky's the limit ethos of the Roaring Twentys, the Maroons did the unthinkable and dominated the NFL in their rookie season. (Their improbable rise was chronicled each week in the local paper by a rookie Pottsville sportswriter named John OOHara.)<p>Little Pottsville outscored its first seven opponents 162-6. The boys so thoroughly pummeled one opponent, angry fans shot up their train car as the Maroons rode out of town. In the final game of that first season the Maroons traveled to the Midwest to face the league-leading Chicago Cardinals in what was viewed as the championship game for 1925. The Maroons overcame a Windy City snowstorm and an injury to their best player to defeat the Cardinals 21-7.</p><p>But the fans wanted more.</p><p>College ball was still king. And as news of PottsvilleOs success was splashed across the news reels and headlines throughout the country, a movement began to have the Maroons face a team of college All-Stars from the University of Notre Dame, featuring the legendary Four Horsemen, the finest collection of talent the game had ever known. Experts believed the NFL was still decades away from competing with college football. But on a neutral field in Philadelphia, in a battle described as The Greatest Football Game Ever Seen, the Maroons shocked the world and turned the football establishment upside-down, defeating Notre Dame 9-7 on a last-second field goal by their captain Charlie Berry who had his kicking cleat bronzed for eternity.</p><p>The championship was theirs. The NFL was finally on the map. The Maroons victory over Notre Dame had legitimized the league. It also destroyed the town and the team that made it all possible.</p><p>Claiming the upstart Maroons had violated the territory of another franchise by playing Notre Dame in Philadelphia, the NFL suspended Pottsville and awarded the 1925 NFL championship to the Chicago Cardinals. The Cardinals refused to accept the bogus title and the 1925 crown was never officially awarded. For more than 80 years, fans of the Pottsville MaroonsNthe team Red Grange said was the greatest he ever facedNhave fought to have the 1925 title returned to its rightful owners.</p><p>With Breaker Boys their remarkable story is told at last.</p></p><p>David Fleming is a seniorwriter for <i>ESPN The Magazine</i> and columnist for ESPN.com's Page 2.

Slow cooking draws out flavours and softens the texture of food to create delicious, impressive, often inexpensive meals with little fuss.There are casseroles and one-pots that slowly simmer to perfection, roasts that tenderize in the oven, soups that quietly bubble away on the hob, puddings such as meringues and fruit compotes, and breads that bake to light perfection.Gennaro is a traditional, rural Italian cook. He uses lots of inexpensive cuts of meat, as well as beans and pulses, which all benefit from slow cooking, so there is plenty for the thrifty home cook to choose from. This is classic Italian food, such as Roast leg of lamb with baby onions, Rich Tyrolean beef goulash, Lasagne and Meringue with zabaglione cream and custard, that takes the hard work out of preparing supper.</p><p><b>Gennaro Contaldo </b>worked in several restaurants around the UK and in London, where he eventually opened the award-winning Passione.

His husband-wife team of Julie and Gideon Oliver (Julie, a supervising park ranger at Olympia National Park in Washington; Gideon, a forensic anthropologist) allows Elkins to do several things at once: get the couple invited to different venues; pack in enough local lore to function as a travel guide for readers; and provide two different perspectives on whatever bones Gideon stumbles across. This time, Julie has been invited to attend a biodiversity conference hosted by an eccentric Russian genius. Gideon pokes around the Neolithic sites and, not surprisingly, finds a contemporary tibia. While the local constabulary is denying that this can possibly be the result of foul play, a murder occurs at Star Castle, the site of the conference. Although the writing is precious at times, the forensic accuracy is admirable, and the plotting compelling. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet this privileged city kid, bully-prey, decided early on never to let his frailties govern his ambitions. Brown uses copious quotations to good measure as he flits through Roosevelt&#x2019;s young life. (The quotes are unsourced, though a bibliography is appended, including Roosevelt&#x2019;s autobiography.) Roosevelt&#x2019;s words help impart the man&#x2019;s predilection for sternly poetic hyperbole: to get fit, &#x201c;he paddled &#x2018;in the hottest sun, over the roughest water, in the smallest boat.&#x2019;&#x201d; The artwork is what one expects from Brown&#x2014;vignettes of scratchy pen-work that capture humor and drama with equal ease&#x2014;and show Teddy&#x2019;s progression from a wispy twig into a big stick. While this account may not possess the laser-beam focus of Brown&#x2019;s recent compact histories Let It Begin Here and All Stations Distress (both 2008), it does have a more kid-friendly hook in the young man whose determination trumped his boyhood shortcomings.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Kate Atkinson was born in New York and now lives in Edinburgh. Her first novel, Behind the Scenes at the Museum, was named Whitbread Book of the Year in the U.K. in 1995 and was followed by Human Croquet and Emotionally Weird.Atkinson, who began her career with Behind the Scenes at the Museum, a Whitbread Book of the Year, and enjoyed good reviews for two more novels, now gathers together this suite of comparatively loosely connected stories. Atkinson's work has grown increasingly diffuse; her most recent book, Emotionally Weird, was printed in three fonts, representing separate strings of narrative. This collection takes that conceit without the typesetting extravagance one step further, opening and closing on two women who seem to tell one another the intervening tales. Atkinson's Scheherazades, singletons of indeterminate age named Charlene and Trudi, appear first in "a food hall as vast as a small city," and by the book's end which may or may not be the end of the world they're starving to death in a squalid, freezing flat in what feels like an apocalyptic present. In the women's restless imaginations, readers meet more than one girlfriend (in different stories, and each unbeknownst to the other) of a man named Hawk; a gaggle of perfect-toothed American Zane sisters; and a governess who may or may not be a goddess. Some of Atkinson's devices a giant cat who impregnates a woman with kittens, an evil twin who gets to have all the fun make for stories as simple as fables, but some, like the nanny goddess and the virtuoso, multiple-voiced "Dissonance," are sharp and memorable, full of astutely observed family dynamics. While not as intense or as unified as Atkinson's full-length work, this is a sharp and wholly original collection. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There are now 48 extra pages, including 17 new color illustrations, 20 new maps, and for the first time ever double page spreads and full-page photos in the atlas section for maximum visual impact. New World coverage has been extended for both Australia and South America; some New World regions even have their own entries for the first time, including Rutherford, Oakville, and Stag&#x2019;s Leap from California; Mendoza (Argentina); Limestone Coast (Australia); Central Otago and Martinborough (New Zealand); and Constantia (South Africa).

The names Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson alone recommend any book on which they appear. The fifth edition (in 30 years) of this astonishingly successful book lives up to, and surpasses, its predecessors. In 350 densely packed but never clotted pages the authors manage the extraordinary feat of characterizing wine production throughout the world, from Vancouver Island to Japan--Buddhists first planted vines in that inhospitably precipitous, monsoon-lashed land over a 1,000 years ago. After a substantial introductory section dealing with the history of wine, its making, storage, and enjoyment, we're off. Starting with (where else?) France and Burgundy, each wine area is summarized in terms of its geography, climate, and preferred vines and the appellations, laws, and traditions that govern production. The discussion of Pomerol, for example, tells you a great deal in one short page. Even since 1994, when the fourth edition came out, vast changes have swept the wine world, and many parts of the atlas have been correspondingly completely reworked. South America, Canada, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Eastern Europe, and the Eastern Mediterranean are among the areas that have benefited. The regional maps that form the core of the book are a triumph of clarity. The whole production constitutes a brilliant achievement of organization and synthesis, forming an indispensable resource for any wine lover at all interested in where the wine they drink comes from and why it tastes the way it does. <i>--Robin Davidson, Amazon.co.uk</i>Hugh Johnson is acclaimed as the worlds favourite wine writer.

Certainly our cupboards are filled with all kinds of machines, tools and gadgets, but we can turn to no other one machine to knead dough, grind meat, slice vegetables, whip egg whites and make ice cream. Because of that, we have come to rely on our stand mixers as trusted culinary companions. </p><p> As cooking teachers, though, we are always surprised to find that so many of our students don't own a stand mixer -- and if they do, they are often unaware of all of its capabilities. One student that stands out in our memories had had her own stand mixer for years, but had never used any attachment other than the whip. She had long ago put away her flat beater and dough hook, never stopping to consider how they might be used. Once we clued her in to the possibilities, she felt as though she had rediscovered an old friend. </p><p> There are many brands of stand mixers on the market, and more and more of them are developing attachments that will revolutionize the time you spend in the kitchen: pasta makers, food grinders, grain mills, juicers and ravioli makers all offer you the chance to be more creative and spend less time making dinner. </p><p> The stand mixer, with all of its available attachments, can now complete almost any culinary task. While the majority of handheld mixers have stood still in their evolution, holding fast to their limited power and functions, the stand mixer has blossomed into a culinary work center capable of saving you time and money. Who would have thought years ago that this machine we've always turned to for preparing lemon meringue pies and cinnamon rolls would be capable of producing perfect pasta or paper-thin mushroom slices or mountains of grated cheese, all so quickly and efficiently? </p><p> The evolution of the stand mixer makes a book like this necessary. Our goal is to help you understand the equipment and ease you into a comfortable working relationship with the machine and its attachments. We have provided you with an assortment of delicious recipes, everything from Hearty Harvest Roasted Vegetable Soup to Mocha Almond Ice Cream. Although many of the recipes require one or more of the additional attachments, the majority concentrate on the standard flat beater, whip and dough hook. </p><p> While you're whipping, kneading and slicing your way through this book, you'll also be gaining valuable insight into basic cooking techniques. Tips on how to achieve success in the kitchen accompany many of the recipes. Our years as culinary instructors have taught us the stumbling blocks that home cooks can experience. We have addressed these issues so that you can cook confidently even when under pressure. </p><p> The recipes cover the globe in flavors and textures, from Moroccan-Style Lamb Turnovers to New England Clam Chowder to Tomatillo Chicken Tamales to Ginger-Spiked Tuna Burgers with Asian Coleslaw. We loved testing every recipe in this book. From simple to spectacular, there is truly something for everyone in this bible of a cookbook. </p><p> So pull out your stand mixer, dust it off and dive into making Shrimp Bisque and French Bread. It's easier than you think. </p></p><h2>Derby Fever (Thoroughbred #53)</h2><p><p><strong> Christina and Melanie are both heading for their first Kentucky Derby as jockeys.

Sounds a lot like life, doesn't it? Building trust, overcoming fear, conducting relationships, and making choices--all without a script.<br><br>Wells establishes theatrical improvisation as a model for Christian ethics, a matter of "faithfully improvising on the Christian tradition." He views the Bible not as a "script" but as a "training school" that shapes the habits and practices of the Christian community. Drawing on scriptural narratives and church history, Wells explains six practices that characterize both improvisation and Christian ethics. His model of improvisation reinforces the goal of Christian ethics--to teach Christians to "embody their faith in the practices of discipleship all the time."</p><p><i>Improvisation</i> establishes theatrical improvisation as a model for Christian ethics, helping Christians embody their faith in the practices of discipleship. A new afterword by Wesley Vander Lugt and Benjamin&nbsp;D. Wayman explores the book's reception and ongoing significance.<br><br>"[A] fresh, engaging approach to Christian ethics."<br>--<b>Gayle Gerber Koontz</b>, <i>Christian Century</i><br><br>"This book is a treasure, a genuine contribution to the field of Christian ethics. In it Wells offers a constructive account of Christian ethics that critiques quandary ethics on the one hand and postliberal ethics on the other. He argues persuasively that the Christian practices of worship, especially baptism and Eucharist, can be helpfully thought of in terms of theatrical improvisation. Such a rethinking uncovers resources in these practices that might otherwise be missed, resources that can guide the church as it seeks to live faithfully in the world."<br>--<b>L.&nbsp;Roger Owens</b>, <i>Modern Theology</i><br><br>"This book is conversant both with academic issues and with the liturgical and pastoral practices of congregational ministry. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wells's account represents a significant advance for the discipline of Christian ethics."<br>--<b>David&nbsp;S. Cunningham</b>, <i>Theology Today</i><br><br>"Wells provides us with skills for the imagination that we might live more faithful (and humorous) lives as Christians. This extraordinarily sophisticated book can be read for profit by those well schooled in the literature of theology and ethics, but more important, this book will satisfy those who hunger and thirst for an account of what it means to live as a Christian in our day."<br>--<b>Stanley Hauerwas</b>, Duke Divinity School<br><br>"This is one of the most relevant, stimulating, and lucid books on Christian ethics to appear for some time. It provides an excellent introduction to current debates in Christian ethics while making its own vivid and sometimes controversial contribution. It is in many places profound and original, and it deserves to be widely read and discussed."<br>--<b>Duncan&nbsp;B. Forrester</b>, University of Edinburgh<br><br>"Bold, creative, and yet showing a deep mastery of his craft, Wells charts a fresh course for Christian theological ethics that is at once artful, contemporary, and faithful both to the Bible and to the best of Christian ethical reflection.

But 15-year-old Jeremy Fields has other things on his mind -- like what to do now that his parents are dead and he&#39;s been swindled out of the family farm. Angry and confused, Jeremy sets out for the town of York, only to lose his few remaining possessions -- and very nearly his life -- when a bridge collapses beneath his feet. Plucked from the river by British soldiers, Jeremy decides to join their regiment.

John Ames is a preacher, the son of a preacher and the grandson (both maternal and paternal) of preachers. It&#x2019;s 1956 in Gilead, Iowa, towards the end of the Reverend Ames&#x2019;s life, and he is absorbed in recording his family&#x2019;s story, a legacy for the young son he will never see grow up. Haunted by his grandfather&#x2019;s presence, John tells of the rift between his grandfather and his father: the elder, an angry visionary who fought for the abolitionist cause, and his son, an ardent pacifist. He is troubled, too, by his prodigal namesake, Jack (John Ames) Boughton, his best friend&#x2019;s lost son who returns to Gilead searching for forgiveness and redemption. Told in John Ames&#x2019;s joyous, rambling voice that finds beauty, humour and truth in the smallest of life&#x2019;s details, <em> Gilead</em> is a song of celebration and acceptance of the best and the worst the world has to offer. At its heart is a tale of the sacred bonds between fathers and sons, pitch-perfect in style and story, set to dazzle critics and readers alike.<br></p></p><p>In 1981, Marilynne Robinson wrote <i>Housekeeping</i>, which won the PEN/Hemingway Award and became a modern classic. Since then, she has written two pieces of nonfiction: <i>Mother Country</i> and <i>The Death of Adam</i>. With <i>Gilead</i>, we have, at last, another work of fiction. As with <i>The Great Fire</i>, Shirley Hazzards's return, 22 years after <i>The Transit of Venus</i>, it was worth the long wait. Books such as these take time, and thought, and a certain kind of genius. There are no invidious comparisons to be made. Robinson's books are unalike in every way but one: the same incisive thought and careful prose illuminate both.<p> The narrator, John Ames, is 76, a preacher who has lived almost all of his life in Gilead, Iowa. He is writing a letter to his almost seven-year-old son, the blessing of his second marriage. It is a summing-up, an apologia, a consideration of his life. Robinson takes the story away from being simply the reminiscences of one man and moves it into the realm of a meditation on fathers and children, particularly sons, on faith, and on the imperfectability of man. </p><p> The reason for the letter is Ames's failing health. He wants to leave an account of himself for this son who will never really know him. His greatest regret is that he hasn't much to leave them, in worldly terms. "Your mother told you I'm writing your begats, and you seemed very pleased with the idea. Well, then. What should I record for you?" In the course of the narrative, John Ames records himself, inside and out, in a meditative style. Robinson's prose asks the reader to slow down to the pace of an old man in Gilead, Iowa, in 1956. Ames writes of his father and grandfather, estranged over his grandfather's departure for Kansas to march for abolition and his father's lifelong pacifism. The tension between them, their love for each other and their inability to bridge the chasm of their beliefs is a constant source of rumination for John Ames. Fathers and sons. </p><p> The other constant in the book is Ames's friendship since childhood with "old Boughton," a Presbyterian minister. Boughton, father of many children, favors his son, named John Ames Boughton, above all others. Ames must constantly monitor his tendency to be envious of Boughton's bounteous family; his first wife died in childbirth and the baby died almost immediately after her. Jack Boughton is a ne'er-do-well, Ames knows it and strives to love him as he knows he should. Jack arrives in Gilead after a long absence, full of charm and mischief, causing Ames to wonder what influence he might have on Ames's young wife and son when Ames dies. </p><p> These are the things that Ames tells his son about: his ancestors, the nature of love and friendship, the part that faith and prayer play in every life and an awareness of one's own culpability. There is also reconciliation without resignation, self-awareness without deprecation, abundant good humor, philosophical queries--Jack asks, "'Do you ever wonder why American Christianity seems to wait for the real thinking to be done elsewhere?'"--and an ongoing sense of childlike wonder at the beauty and variety of God's world.</p><p> In Marilynne Robinson's hands, there <i>is</i> a balm in Gilead, as the old spiritual tells us. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><p><strong>MARILYNNE ROBINSON</strong> is the recipient of a 2012 National Humanities Medal, awarded by President Barack Obama, for &#x201c;her grace and intelligence in writing.&#x201d; In 2013 she was awarded South Korea&#x2019;s Park Kyong-ni Prize for her contribution to international literature.

As "his novels shaped his life as much as his life shaped his novels," Smiley's <b>Charles Dickens</b> is at once a sensitive profile of the great master and a fascinating meditation on the writing life.<br><br>Smiley evokes Dickens as he might have seemed to his contemporaries: convivial, astute, boundlessly energetic-and lionized. As she makes clear, Dickens not only led the action-packed life of a prolific writer, editor, and family man but, balancing the artistic and the commercial in his work, he also consciously sustained his status as one of the first modern "celebrities."<br><br> <b>Charles Dickens</b> offers brilliant interpretations of almost all the major works, an exploration of his narrative techniques and his innovative voice and themes, and a reflection on how his richly varied lower-class cameos sprang from an experience and passion more personal than his public knew. Smiley's own "demon narrative intelligence" (<b>The Boston Globe</b>) touches, too, on controversial details that include Dickens's obsession with money and squabbles with publishers, his unhappy marriage, and the rumors of an affair.<br><br> Here is a fresh look at the dazzling personality of a verbal magician and the fascinating times behind the classics we read in school and continue to enjoy today.</p><p>Jane Smiley's ten works of fiction include <b>The Age of Grief</b>, <b>The Greenlanders</b>, <b>Ordinary Love and Good Will</b>, <b>Moo</b>, <b>A Thousand Acres</b> (which won the Pulitzer Prize), and most recently the bestselling <b>Horse Heaven</b>.<b>Chapter One</b><p>Charles Dickens was a public man and a famous man, and he assumed both of these slightly different roles in his early twenties. His first sketch, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk," was published in the Monthly Magazine in December 1833. Dickens, born on February 7, 1812, was only twenty-one, but because of his work as a parliamentary reporter (he had taught himself shorthand and was able to take down speeches word for word), he was already familiar with seeing his name in print. Nevertheless, he related later that "I walked down to Westminster Hall, and turned into it for half an hour, because my eyes were so dimmed with joy and pride, that they could not bear the street, and were not fit to be seen there." Further sketches published in monthly and weekly magazines over the following months attracted considerable notice, and when Sketches by Boz appeared in volume form in February and December 1836, they were well reviewed. What everyone, including Dickens himself, considered especially remarkable was their breadth of scope, and in particular the variety of lower-class characters and scenes depicted, perhaps a first in English literature. One reviewer called them "a perfect picture of the morals, manners, and habits of a great portion of English Society."</p><p>At only twenty-four, Dickens found himself in an advantageous authorial position-he was invited to contribute the text for a series of sporting engravings to be published by the firm of Chapman and Hall. They offered Dickens �14 per month (it is impossible to know exactly what this would be equivalent to in modern dollars, but it is useful to multiply any Dickensian sum by 35, which would make his fee about $500). The artist, Robert Seymour, was successful and famous, and it was he who was supposed to take the lead in conceiving and guiding the collaboration. The arrangement lasted two months, until Seymour committed suicide. In even this short a time, though, Dickens was able to assert his own resolve that he should direct the project, and by the time another artist, Hablot Browne, was hired, Dickens had gotten himself a raise, increased the proportion of the writing to the illustrations, and turned the whole endeavor into The Pickwick Papers, which was destined to become a publishing phenomenon.</p><p>The Pickwick Papers was published between March 1836 and November 1837. From that time to the end of his life, Charles Dickens was a figure of whom everyone had something to say, so it is appropriate to take a look at him upon his first real entrance into the condition of celebrity. First and foremost, friends and acquaintances noted his lively presence, his charm, his good looks, and his colorful style of dress. Though rather short, and even slight, Dickens was extremely straight in his bearing, and his friend and future biographer John Forster recalled "the quickness, keenness, and practical power, the eager, restless, energetic outlook....Light and motion flashed from every part of it." Forster asserted that humor, "habitual, unbounded, and resistless," was his most essential characteristic, but everyone he knew expressed astonishment at Dickens's level of activity, whether the object of that activity was work, games, exercise, amateur acting and play production, charitable projects, or anything else. He was good company and he loved all sociable amusements. He later commented that at this time of his life he was going out to the theater sometimes every night of the week-not only to see the more respectable offerings at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, but to any and all sorts of shows, spectacles, pageants, and performances. Himself adept at declaiming, singing, and performing, he was invited everywhere and participated fully in all forms of the social life of the time-parties and "at homes," nights on the town with groups of male friends, dinners, jaunts, impromptu adventures. Already, though, observers were finding something uncanny about his manner. As astute as he was charming, he often gave people the sense that they were being "scanned" from top to bottom. Extant portraits and photographs certainly fail to reveal the Dickens that his contemporaries knew, especially in the early years, since for various technical reasons subjects were never pictured or photographed smiling. It is especially important, therefore, to be mindful that what the twenty-first century is able to see of Dickens is the merest brittle shell of how he appeared to those around him.</p><p>The Pickwick Papers sold fewer than 500 copies of the first monthly number. The fourth number sold 4,000, the eleventh 14,000, and the last numbers around 40,000. Once published in volume form, it sold well for the rest of Dickens's life and after. By 1878, it had sold 1.6 million copies in various editions.</p><p>The success of his literary efforts enabled Dickens to progress in his private life, and on the second of April 1836, he married Catherine Hogarth, the daughter of George Hogarth, the editor of the newly established Evening Chronicle, a journal to which Dickens contributed twenty pieces. The Hogarths were Scottish, and before becoming a journalist George had been a lawyer in Edinburgh and the legal adviser and intimate friend of Walter Scott, an author Dickens very much admired. Catherine was the eldest of nine children, and the Hogarths were a lively, clever family. George himself was an accomplished musician and served as music critic of another newspaper that Dickens had written for, the Morning Chronicle.</p><p>The twenty-four-year-old Dickens embraced the Hogarth family and, in turn, was embraced by them. He was impressed with their cultural connections, their liveliness, and their talents, especially the musical ones, which Dickens had a particular affinity for, being himself a performer and ready singer of popular songs, and he treated not only George but also Mrs. Hogarth with great affection. It may have seemed to him that he had found the one family that perfectly reflected his own aspirations to a hardworking prominence that was both artistic and bourgeois. An earlier suit had failed. His beloved, a young woman named Maria Beadnell, daughter of a banker, whom he had courted obsessively for four years, had finally rejected him (or her connections had broken off the relationship-the circumstances remain unclear) in May 1833.</p><p>Catherine Hogarth was a placid and gentle young woman of twenty quite unlike Maria Beadnell. Dickens's letters to her show that he felt affectionate toward Catherine, though not especially passionate, and that he took directing and molding her as seriously as he took pleasing and courting her-he was moving eagerly into the accepted Victorian role of paterfamilias. He also grew quite fond of, and intimate with, Catherine's younger sister Mary, who moved in with the young couple. His marriage and his relationship with the Hogarths, then, nicely expressed who he thought himself to be at the time, as well as his ideal of family life-a sort of cozy, busy, fecund, sociable, and comfortable household where people with imagination, energy, and considerable social mobility could gather and find both enjoyment and stimulation. The family formed by Charles, Catherine, and Mary seems to have suited all of them, and for Dickens it was as close as he ever came to domestic happiness. The gentle and affectionate, but somewhat languid Catherine satisfied the role of wife and mother, while the quicker Mary offered a more virginal and intellectual form of female companionship.</p><p>By the age of twenty-four, Dickens had already been working for nine years. He had applied himself to every task with vigor, and through a mixture of indefatigable endeavor, talent, imagination, charm, and focus, he had succeeded at nearly everything he tried. Only his great passion for acting had been stymied: on the day of his audition as a professional actor, he had fallen ill with a cold. Publication, of course, and the huge success of Pickwick fixed his professional course, but he could never be said to have "failed" at acting-he came back to it over and over, in amateur theatricals and other performances, and always received excellent reviews. In addition, in this same period, he became friends with William Charles Macready, one of the greatest actors of the Victorian period, a man who did much to rehabilitate the plays of William Shakespeare from the corrupted versions common in the eighteenth century.</p><p>Foremost among Dickens's friends was John Forster, another literary bon vivant and another ambitious and self-made man. Dickens and Forster were close associates in every way for the rest of Dickens's life, in personal, artistic, and public affairs. Forster handled many of Dickens's business matters, was his artistic and editorial adviser on many projects, and at last wrote the first and in some ways the most exhaustive (though discreet) Dickens biography. There were plenty of other friends, mostly artists, authors, and other men of the artistic/public sort.</p><p>Dickens's own family was like an unsuccessful version of the Hogarth family. John Dickens was a skilled journalist, also of a convivial temperament, and considered to be a man of some charm. Of Elizabeth Dickens, too, it was said that she was vivacious and winning. But the elder Dickenses had led a life of such improvidence, marked by so many changes in circumstances, that Charles Dickens's attitude toward them, both together and individually, was at the very least extremely complex and in some ways a contrast to his general charitableness. In the early years of his marriage and professional success, he was tormented by the fecklessness as well as the importunities of his parents and his brothers. With success and marriage, he had separated himself from the life he had led with them (a life that he hardly ever spoke of), but he could not as easily separate himself from his relations themselves. He attempted to find them work, to find them places to live (sometimes at quite a distance), to keep them at arm's length, but he repeatedly found himself bailing them out of financial difficulties. This was especially true of his father, and Dickens often spoke of his parents with exasperation in letters to friends. Even so, for fifteen months, it seemed as though Charles and Catherine Dickens were especially favored in every way-Dickens was busy, rich, and popular. He knew at once and without being told how interconnected fame, money, influence, and artistic independence were, and he asserted himself almost immediately to sustain all four of them through hard work, aggressive business dealings, and self-promotion. And, of course, the exercise of genius.</p><p>Catherine Dickens gave birth to Charles junior on January 2, 1837, and in April the couple moved out of their rooms into a house. Then, on May 7, after an illness of only a few days, seventeen-year-old Mary Hogarth died suddenly. She died in Dickens's arms, and he was so undone by the loss that he had to put off completing the installment of The Pickwick Papers that he was working on. He wore one of her rings on his finger for the rest of his life and kept a lock of her hair and her clothes. When, five years later, one of her brothers died and was buried with her, Dickens wrote that "the thought of being excluded from her dust" was like "losing her a second time." Over the course of the next thirty years, he thought of her constantly and did not think that the influence of her spirit over him could be exaggerated. She is often said to have inspired several of Dickens's female characters of a certain type, of which Agnes, in David Copperfield, is an example-virtuous, compliant, and virginal, voiceless in a sense, and almost always too good for this world. Catherine could never take her place or fill, by herself, the two roles that Dickens needed filled by the women in his life.</p><p>� � �</p><p>The Pickwick Papers is not a book that holds much appeal for the modern reader. Episodic sporting adventures, however, were quite popular at the time, and a large part of their appeal was in the accompanying illustrations. The "novel" has the looseness and digressiveness of many eighteenth-century works like Tom Jones and Tristram Shandy, both of which Dickens admired. Dickens had not at that point developed his particular social vision, especially the darker, angrier parts of it, and his style, though already distinct, does not have the incandescent and concentrated ironic power that he achieved in later works. What he does have, full grown, and what readers noticed almost at once, is that facility in drawing characters that are not only entertaining but unique. An early example is Alfred Jingle, who joins Pickwick's party of friends and at first seems benign enough. His characteristic mode of expression is a sort of word-association utterance of disjointed cant phrases: "Splendid-capital. Kent, sir-everybody knows Kent-apples, cherries, hops, and women. Glass of wine, sir?" And a few moments later: "'Beg your pardon, sir,' said the stranger, 'bottle stands-pass it round-way of the sun-through the button-hole-no heeltaps.'" The Pickwickians are deceived by Jingle's bonhomie and apparent savoir faire, until he attempts to elope with the sister of their host. Only when he is being bought off by the man's lawyer does he speak in coherent sentences. When the lawyer suggests that �50 is a "good round sum-a man like you could treble it in no time-great deal to be done with fifty pounds, my dear sir," Jingle has no trouble responding "coolly," "More to be done with a hundred and fifty." Jingle's mode of expression is funny in itself, partly because it is mechanical and repetitive in rhythm and partly because the associated phrases are unexpected, and the shift to a more normal speech pattern reveals and underscores Jingle's duplicity. This is the absolute heart of Charles Dickens's idiosyncratic genius: what Jingle communicates to the reader, and what Dickens communicates through him, accumulates meanings and layers with every piece of dialogue and is simultaneously interesting and economical. And Jingle's style stands in contrast with the narrator's and the Pickwickians' more discursive manner, adding yet another layer.</p><p>Throughout his life, Dickens had a superb talent for mimicry, for speaking in voices, that almost amounted to allowing the voices all around him to speak through him. It was a talent he cultivated, but also himself marveled at, telling Forster that his characters came to him and spoke through him. David Lodge, one of the foremost comic novelists of our own day, and an experienced theorist, has written in After Bakhtin that the only way successfully to come to terms with the variety and scope of the novel is through analyzing it as a chorus of individual voices speaking in varying styles and tones, rather than as a single rhetorical expression. This is certainly true of Dickens as much as or more than any other novelist.

Transported back in time more than 100 years, she finds herself walking up a lonely road as the imposing stone turrets of Langley Castle draw nearer and nearer. Then she looses the ring, and unless she can find it, she will remain lost in a bygone age. A multifaceted tale of time travel and historical fiction unfolds against the complexities of Irish politics in 1885 (which may not strike a responsive chord with many intended readers.) Numerous black-and-white sketches illustrate the style of living and the levels of servants in a wealthy household, and afford a brief glimpse of life among the rural poor outside the castle walls. Initially a rather spoiled and selfish child, Lucy becomes a nursery maid and is forced to recognize an individual's worth whether "upstairs" or "downstairs." MacGrory's evocative language, coupled with myriad details of daily life, reconstructs an age unknown to most. The book is rather lengthy, but the size and number of sketches so finely attuned to the text will bolster its appeal. A definite purchase to answer requests for "a book set in a foreign country," time travel, or historical fiction.<br><i>Joanne Kelleher, Commack Public Library, </i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 4-6. This Irish time-travel fantasy is a good old-fashioned story in every sense. Just before her eleventh birthday, Lucy receives from her grandmother a ruby ring with a dramatic history and the power to grant two wishes. When Lucy wishes to live in a "much larger house," she's magically transported to a nearby castle in a time long past, 1885. There she earns her keep as the nursery maid until she can adapt to her new position, befriend the two children in the nursery, regain her missing ring, and wish herself home again. Just as the book seems about to end disappointingly in the "was it all a dream?" mode, Lucy's parents take her to the same castle for her birthday treat. She rediscovers her strangely distant yet immediate past insistently preserved by the two children who had grown up in the house a century before. Intriguing and convincing in its depiction of the historical era, the book shows clearly the discomforts as well as the romanticized elements of the times. The fantasy adds another dimension. Though Lucy's maturity seems to come rather suddenly, it's the hard-won reward of trials endured. Fans of Pearce's <i>Tom's Midnight Garden</i> will find an echo of its power as the two eras converge at the end, poignantly underscored by Lucy's sudden, concrete understanding of the passage of time. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i></p><h2>Old Time Remedies for Modern Ailments</h2><p>Old Time Remedies for Modern Ailments [Paperback]</p><p></p><h2>Friendship</h2><p>This collection of literature attempts to compile many of the classic works that have stood the test of time and offer them at a reduced, affordable price, in an attractive volume so that everyone can enjoy them.</p><p></p><h2>In Miniature: How Small Things Illuminate the World</h2><p><b>Bestselling, award-winning writer Simon Garfield returns with an enthralling investigation of humans&#x2019; peculiar fascination with small things&#x2014;and what small things tell us about our larger world.</b><br><br><b>&#x201c;[Simon Garfield is] an exuberant truffle-hound of the recondite and delightful factoid.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Sunday Times</i> (London)</b><br><br>Simon Garfield writes books that shine a light on aspects of the everyday world in order to reveal the charms and eccentricities hiding in plain sight around us.

Venues such as the Vulcan Gas Company and the Armadillo World Headquarters hosted both innovative local musicians and big-name touring acts. Poster artists not only advertised the performances&#x2014;they visually defined the music and culture of Austin during this pivotal period. Their posters promoted an alternative lifestyle that permeated the city and reflected Austin's transformation from a sleepy university town into a veritable oasis of underground artistic and cultural activity in the state of Texas.</p><p>This book presents a definitive survey of music poster art produced in Austin between 1967 and 1982. It vividly illustrates four distinct generations of posters&#x2014;psychedelic art of the Vulcan Gas Company, early works from the Armadillo World Headquarters, an emerging variety of styles from the mid-1970s, and the radical visual aesthetic of punk&#x2014;produced by such renowned artists as Gilbert Shelton, Jim Franklin, Kerry Awn, Micael Priest, Guy Juke, Ken Featherston, NOXX, and Danny Garrett.

It shows investors how to use innovative techniques and fundamental business analysis to spot Wall Street bargains.</p><p>The son of author Philip Fisher (<i>Common Stocks &amp; Uncommon Profits</i>), rebel Ken had to make his own way in the investment world. <i>Super Stocks</i> is the product of his unique take on investing in the stock market. Eschewing a good deal of his father's no-numbers approach, Ken popularized the use of the price/sales ratio (PSR) and price/research ratio (PRR) in this 1984 classic that earned him a permanent spot as a columnist in <i>Forbes</i>. Although Fisher hardly invented the price/sales ratio, his emphasis of it is unmatched in investment history, save perhaps Ernie Kiehne, formerly of Legg Mason's Value Fund. <p> Fisher's <i>Super Stocks</i> is an idiosyncratic romp through the technology heyday of the early '80s. Fisher tells story after story of how high-fliers hit a short-term flame-out he called the "glitch" and the price/sales ratio and price/research ratio got him in at the bottom. Although he only gives quantitative price/sales ratios on technology-related stocks for the 1983 and 1984 time frame, his ability to construct an entire approach to valuation outside of the earnings-preoccupied mainstream still makes for compelling reading. Fisher has not completely escaped his father, though. The guy talks about the businesses he buys in lurid detail, advising investors that to be successful they need to do the same. As rich in investment war stories as it is in knowledge, <i>Super Stocks</i> makes for an excellent read.</p><p><b>Kenneth Fisher</b> is the founder, chairman, and CEO of Fisher Investments, an independent global money management firm with more than $30 billion in assets.

Kennedy Caused the Assassination of JFK</h2><p>Focusing for the first time on why attorney general Robert F. Kennedy wasn&#x2019;t killed in 1963 instead of on why President John F. Kennedy was, Mark Shaw offers a stunning and provocative assassination theory that leads directly to the family patriarch, Joseph P. Kennedy. Mining fresh information and more than forty new interviews, Shaw weaves a spellbinding narrative involving Mafia don Carlos Marcello; Jack Ruby (Lee Harvey Oswald&#x2019;s killer); Ruby&#x2019;s attorney, Melvin Belli; and, ultimately, the Kennedy brothers and their father.<br><br>Shaw addresses these tantalizing questions: Why, shortly after his brother&#x2019;s death, did a grief-stricken RFK tell a colleague, &#x201c;I thought they would get one of us . . . I thought it would be me&#x201d;? Why was Belli, an attorney with almost no defense experience (but proven ties to the Mafia), chosen as Jack Ruby&#x2019;s attorney? How does Belli&#x2019;s Mafia connection call into question his legal strategy, which ultimately led to the Ruby&#x2019;s first-degree murder conviction and death sentence? What was Joseph Kennedy&#x2019;s relationship to organized crime? And how was his insistence that JFK appoint RFK as attorney general tantamount to signing the president&#x2019;s death warrant?<br><br>For fifty years, Shaw maintains, researchers investigating the president&#x2019;s murder in Dallas have been looking at the wrong motives and actors. <i>The Poison Patriarch </i>offers a shocking reassessment&#x2014;one that is sure to alter the course of future assassination debates.</p><p><strong>Mark Shaw</strong> author of twenty-plus books, is a former criminal defense attorney who has served as a legal analyst for ABC, ESPN, and USA Today.

He lives in Superior, Colorado.&#x201c;Did a well-known society lawyer keep the secrets of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy? . . . Shaw takes an unusual route into the thicket of JFK conspiracy literature, focusing on the perturbing question of why the flamboyant civil attorney Melvin Belli, an associate of mobsters, would have been recruited to provide Jack Ruby&#x2019;s defense following his televised shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald.&#x201d; (<strong>Kirkus Reviews</strong>)</p><h2>Deadly Deceits: My 25 Years in the CIA</h2><p><p>A new, updated edition of this classic account of the CIA's deeds and deceptions by one of its formerly most prized recruits. </p><p>"One of the outstanding books written by former CIA agents."-Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair</p></p><p></p><h2>The Geometry of Imperialism: The Limits of Hobson&#39;s Paradigm</h2><p>Few terms in the vocabulary of politics are so confused as &#x201c;imperialism.&#x201d; Does it refer essentially to colonial rule? Or is it primarily an economic phenomenon, connected to the export of capital? What is its relation to nationalism? Which societies, in the past or present, can be properly described as imperialist?<br><br>Giovanni Arrighi resolves these ambiguities by the construction of a formal model that integrates all of them into a single structure. He shows how a coherent paradigm of imperialism can be derived from Hobson&#x2019;s classic study of imperialism at the turn of the century, and illustrates it with a series of geometrical figures. The genesis of English imperialism is traced, from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries. Then the pattern of German and American imperialism are compared and contrasted.

Even when I was a baby in my cradle. My mother didn&#x2019;t hear. My father didn&#x2019;t hear. My sisters continued sleeping. But the cat looked up.<br><br>When I was old enough I opened the door. There she was. A lady wearing a gray coat. She had a branch from a hawthorn tree, the one that grew outside my window. She spoke, but I didn&#x2019;t know her language. A big wind had come up and the door slammed shut. When I opened it again, she was gone.<br><br>But I knew what she wanted.<br><br>Me.<br><br>The one word I&#x2019;d understood was daughter.<br><br>I asked my mother to tell me about the day I was born. She couldn&#x2019;t remember. I asked my father. He had no idea. My sisters were too young to know where I&#x2019;d come from. When the gray lady next came, I asked the same question. I could tell from the look on her face. She knew the answer. She went down to the marsh, where the tall reeds grew, where the river began. I ran to keep up. She slipped into the water, all gray and murky. She waited for me to follow. I didn&#x2019;t think twice. I took off my boots. The water was cold. I went under fast.<br><br>It was April in New York City and from the window of their room at the Plaza Hotel everything looked bright and green. The Story sisters were sharing a room on the evening of their grandparents&#x2019; fiftieth anniversary party. Their mother trusted them completely. They were not the sort of teenagers who would steal from the minibar only to wind up drunk in the hallway, sprawled out on the carpet or nodding off in a doorway, embarrassing themselves and their families. They would never hang out the window to wave away cigarette smoke or toss water balloons onto unsuspecting pedestrians below. They were diligent, beautiful girls, well behaved, thoughtful. Most people were charmed to discover that the girls had a private, shared language. It was lovely to hear, musical. When they spoke to each other, they sounded like birds.<br><br>The eldest girl was Elisabeth, called Elv, now fifteen. Meg was only a year younger, and Claire had just turned twelve. Each had long dark hair and pale eyes, a startling combination. Elv was a disciplined dancer, the most beautiful in many people&#x2019;s opinions, the one who had invented the Story sisters&#x2019; secret world. Meg was a great reader and was never without a book; while walking to school she often had one open in her hands, so engrossed she would sometimes trip while navigating familiar streets. Claire was diligent, kindhearted, never one to shirk chores. Her bed was made before her sisters opened their sleepy eyes. She raked the lawn and watered the garden and always went to sleep on time. All were self-reliant and practical, honor students any parents would be proud to claim as their own. But when the girls&#x2019; mother came upon them chattering away in that language no one else could understand, when she spied maps and graphs that meant nothing to her, that defined another world, her daughters made her think of clouds, something far away and inaccessible.<br><br>Annie and the girls&#x2019; father had divorced four years earlier, the summer of the gypsy moths when all of the trees in their yard were bare, the leaves chewed by caterpillars. You could hear crunching in the night. You could see silvery cocoon webbing in porch rafters and strung across stop signs. People said there were bound to be hard times ahead for the Storys. Alan was a high school principal, his schedule too full for many visits. He&#x2019;d been the one who&#x2019;d wanted out of the marriage, and after the split he&#x2019;d all but disappeared. At the age of forty-seven, he&#x2019;d become a ladies&#x2019; man, or maybe it was simply that there weren&#x2019;t many men around at that stage of the game. Suddenly he was in demand. There was another woman in the background during the breakup. She&#x2019;d quickly been replaced by a second girlfriend the Story sisters had yet to meet. But so far there had been no great disasters despite the divorce and all of the possible minefields that accompanied adolescence. Annie and her daughters still lived in the same house in North Point Harbor, where a big hawthorn tree grew outside the girls&#x2019; bedroom window. People said it had been there before Long Island was settled and that it was the oldest tree for miles around. In the summertime much of the Storys&#x2019; yard was taken up with a large garden filled with rows of tomato plants. There was a stone birdbath at the center and a latticework trellis that was heavy with climbing sweet peas and tremulous, prickly cucumber vines. The Story sisters could have had small separate bedrooms on the first floor, but they chose to share the attic. They preferred one another&#x2019;s company to rooms of their own. When Annie heard them behind the closed door, whispering conspiratorially to each other in that secret vocabulary of theirs, she felt left out in some deep, hurtful way. Her oldest girl sat up in the hawthorn tree late at night; she said she was looking at stars, but she was there even on cloudy nights, her black hair even blacker against the sky. Annie was certain that people who said daughters were easy had never had girls of their own.<br><br>Today the Story sisters were all in blue. Teal and azure and sapphire. They liked to wear similar clothes and confuse people as to who was who. Usually they wore jeans and T-shirts, but this was a special occasion. They adored their grandmother Natalia, whom they called Ama, a name Elv had bestowed upon her as a toddler. Their ama was Russian and elegant and wonderful. She&#x2019;d fallen in love with their grandfather in France. Although the Rosens lived on Eighty- ninth Street, they kept their apartment where Natalia had lived as a young woman in the Marais district of Paris, near the Place du March�- Sainte-Catherine, and as far as the Story sisters were concerned, it was the most wonderful spot in the world.<br><br>Annie and the girls visited once a year. They were infatuated with Paris. They had dreams of long days filled with creamy light and meals that lasted long into the hazy blur of evening. They loved French ice cream and the glasses of blue-white milk. They studied beautiful women and tried to imitate the way they walked, the way they tied their scarves so prettily. They always traveled to France for spring vacation. The chestnut tree in the courtyard was in bloom then, with its scented white flowers.<br><br>The Plaza was probably the second-best place in the world. Annie went to the girls&#x2019; room to find her daughters clustered around the window, gazing at the horse-drawn carriages down below. From a certain point of view the sisters looked like women, tall and beautiful and poised, but they were still children in many ways, the younger girls especially. Meg said that when she got married she wanted to ride in one of those carriages. She would wear a white dress and carry a hundred roses. The girls&#x2019; secret world was called Arnelle. Arnish for rose was minta. It was the single word Annie understood. Alana me sora minta, Meg was saying. Roses wherever you looked.<br><br>&#x201c;How can you think about that now?&#x201d; Elv gestured out the window. She was easily outraged and hated mistreatment of any sort. &#x201c;Those carriage horses are malnourished,&#x201d; she informed her sister.<br><br>Elv had always been an animal fanatic. Years ago she&#x2019;d found a rabbit, mortally wounded by a lawn mower&#x2019;s blades, left to bleed to death in the velvety grass of the Weinsteins&#x2019; lawn. She&#x2019;d tried her best to nurse it to health, but in the end the rabbit had died in a shoebox, covered up with a doll&#x2019;s blanket. Afterward she and Meg and Claire had held a funeral, burying the shoebox beneath the back porch, but Elv had been inconsolable. If we don&#x2019;t take care of the creatures who have no voice, she&#x2019;d whispered to her sisters, then who will? She tried to do exactly that. She left out seeds for the mourning doves, opened cans of tuna fish for stray cats, set out packets of sugar for the garden moths. She had begged for a dog, but her mother had neither the time nor the patience for a pet. Annie wasn&#x2019;t about to disrupt their home life. She had no desire to add another personality to the mix, not even that of a terrier or a spaniel.<br><br>Elv was wearing the darkest of the dresses, a deep sapphire, the one her sisters coveted. They wanted to be everything she was and traipsed after her faithfully. The younger girls were rapt as she ranted on about the carriage horses. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re made to ride around without food or water all day long. They&#x2019;re worked until they&#x2019;re nothing but skin and bones.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Skin and bones&#x201d; was a favorite phrase of Elv&#x2019;s. It got to the brutal point. The secret universe she had created was a faery realm where women had wings and it was possible to read thoughts. Arnelle was everything the human world was not. Speech was unnecessary, treachery out of the question. It was a world where no one could take you by surprise or tell you a mouthful of lies. You could see someone&#x2019;s heart through his chest and know if he was a goblin, a mortal, or a true hero. You could divine a word&#x2019;s essence by a halo of color&#x2014;red was false, white was true, yellow was the foulest of lies. There were no ropes to tie you, no iron bars, no stale bread, no one to shut and lock the door.<br><br>Elv had begun to whisper Arnelle stories to her sisters during the bad summer when she was eleven. It was hot that August; the grass had turned brown. In other years summer had been Elv&#x2019;s favorite season&#x2014;no school, long days, the bay only a bicycle ride away from their house on Nightingale Lane. But that summer all she&#x2019;d wanted was to lock herself away with her sisters. They hid in their mother&#x2019;s garden, beneath the trailing pea vines. The tomato plants were veiled by a glinting canopy of bottle-green leaves. The younger girls were eight and ten.

She eventually finds the boy: a surfer named Kaito D&#x14d;moto. However, Kaito does not recognize Lucia in her human form. She cannot directly tell Kaito who she really is; otherwise, according to mermaid legend, she would turn into bubbles. Lucia tries to convince Kaito into figuring out who she really is (since the legend doesn't say anything about the other person discovering a mermaid's true identity by himself). At the same time, Lucia has been told that a group of water demons have invaded the sea world and she must gather six other Mermaid Princesses and their pearls to bring back the legendary goddess Aqua Regina to stop them. To fulfill this, she joins forces with Hanon and Rina, the Mermaid Princesses who came up to dry land, use their pearls, turn into singing teen idols, and use their voices as an offensive power.</p><p></p><h2>Dark Harvest (Maplecreek Amish Trilogy #2)</h2><p>Dark Harvest by Karen Harper released on May 25, 2004 is available now for purchase.</p><p>Karen Harper is the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;and<em> USA TODAY</em> bestselling author of romantic suspense.

She could feel the cool morning breeze in the ache of her reconstructed hip and wrist as well as on her sweaty palms. Imagine, metal screws holding together bones in a woman her age. At least now she could sympathize with Morelli's early arthritis.<br><br>But Kat was relieved she'd never have to work the city streets again. The reality of little John Seyjack's murder at the hands of his berserk father and then Seyjack Senior's death during the ensuing SWAT team response had shaken her to her core, even though she had been unconscious during all that.<br><br>She wasn't sure she could face the unknowns of being a cop again. She'd been through hell this past year, almost bleeding to death, then a lengthy hospital stay, hip and wrist surgery, and walking on crutches, then a cane. Rehab had been grueling to regain her ADL's, activities of daily living, which did <em>not </em>include ever shooting a gun again. That was a necessity for an active duty cop, so her dream career was as fractured as her bones.<br><br>Kat had been through counseling, too, though she hardly needed a shrink to realize she blamed herself for causing the child's death. She knew it had ripped open her wound of festering guilt from losing her little brother years ago. But she still felt she was to blame for taking Jay away from their first foster home. The result was their separation when placed in their second homes. Jay had died of a burst appendix because his foster family believed in prayer more than in doctors. If she hadn't rebelled in the first foster home, however rough it was, they would have been together. She'd have gotten him help when he became sick. No psychiatrist could really help her, because she could never make up for it, never forgive herself for the deaths of Jay and John.<br><br>Two months ago, Kat had pulled herself out of her depression and had taken training to become a police dispatcher, though she'd probably die of boredom doing it. And it would be a real downer not to be on the streets anymore. Since she had no ties in Columbus beyond a few friends on the force, and she had less in common with them every day, she'd chosen a clean break with her past.<br><br>Last month she had moved here to northeast Ohio, which she'd always thought of as peaceful Amish country. She'd rented an upstairs apartment from a widow in the town of Pleasant, near Maplecreek, the county seat. At first she spent her time hitting the antique sales she'd always loved, carefully bargaining for pieces she could use or resell. But her nest egg had dwindled, so she'd applied for the job of the Roscoe County Sheriff's Police and Emergency Vehicle Dispatcher. If she didn't get it, she'd surely find something else to tide her over until she could get an antiques resale business going. That was her new goal in life.<br><br>"Katherine Anne Lindley, go get 'em," she whispered as she went in the double doors of the new civic center, which served as police station, volunteer fire department and mayor's office.<br><br>The current day dispatcher, a pregnant young woman who explained she was also filling in for the receptionist, who was at a dentist's appointment, greeted her warmly and took her right in to meet Sheriff Ray Martin in his large, glass-walled office.<br><br>"Katherine, real glad to meet you," he said, shaking her hand. He indicated a maple colonial chair and held it for her as if seating her at a table. The chair's padded cushion was covered in quilted calico with a ruffle.<br><br>"It's a real pleasure," he added as he sat in his own chair across his cluttered desk. The handsome wood console behind him held the expected fax machine, PC screen and keyboard, but also ceramic planters full of sprawling ivy and a slew of what must be his kids' photos.<br><br>"Please, call me Kat. I haven't been Katherine for years," she told him, returning his bright smile. The man and his office fit the area. Maplecreek's large farms, mostly Amish-owned, the gift shops, bed-and-breakfasts, "Dutch" restaurants, and small commercial ventures made a real stew-pot of past and present. The town could have been straight out of a Currier and Ives print, but for the continual onslaught of tourists who came to gawk, eat and buy, just as Kat often had.<br><br>Sheriff Martin was about fifty, five foot eleven, a sturdy-looking man with military-cut, silvering hair and the hint of an incipient potbelly, though he wore his crisp-looking brown and tan uniform well. His hazel eyes were alert and interested as he led her through initial small talk. Their conversation showed Kat he loved his job and his jurisdiction. His youngest son, Mark&#x2014;the sheriff showed her a picture of himself with a plump, smiling wife and three kids&#x2014;was currently quarterbacking the consolidated high school team, and they had a big game tonight. It was homecoming, so they were going to have fireworks at halftime.<br><br>Maplecreek was the place he had grown up in and returned to after military service, Ray Martin told her, putting her even more at ease by almost letting her interview <em>him. </em>He rocked slightly in his swivel chair as they chatted. She felt she could trust him, though she'd learned the hard way that she stunk at quick character assessments.<br><br>"Before we discuss the specific duties of this job," Sheriff Martin went on, "I just want us to be clear about your move here. It's a long-term thing, that right?"<br><br>"Yes, I've pulled up stakes in Columbus. And I don't want you to have any questions about all I've been through lately. After an incident went&#x2014;" Her voice snagged and she took a deep breath. "After it went very bad last year, I was shot. I was investigated by Internal Affairs for the way I handled a situation. But I was cleared. Actually, the man who shot me had not only abused his son but robbed several banks in the Columbus suburbs."<br><br>He nodded. "Gotta admit I read all about you online, Kat. Besides the IA guys clearing you, I see you got a string of awards, American Legion of Valor, all that. Listen, I understand about needing life changes and that it can be tough to readjust. For years, Roscoe County had one sheriff. Like a king around here, Sheriff Barnes was&#x2014;did things his own way, so folks come to expect business as usual from me. But we got us this new civic center, new leadership, new ways of doing things. This area's growing and changing, with even some residential developments creeping in. It looks real idyllic and peaceful here'bouts, but it's full of folks who don't always see eye-to-eye, which you'll learn soon enough working in this office."<br><br>"If you're offering me the job, Sheriff, I'm ready to accept."<br><br>"Good," he said, getting up to shake her hand again, as if that sealed it. "Tell you what. How about I let you meet the office staff and spend an hour or so with the day dispatcher today, 'cause she can explain what she does better'n me. If it's fine by you, you can start on Monday. I'm real shorthanded, and it'll be good to have a dispatcher who knows the ropes about enforcement, too, know what I mean?"<br><br>If she didn't know, Kat figured, in a town this tiny and an area this rural, she would soon.<br><br>"Eli," Luke Brand told his nine-year-old son in the low German dialect the Amish always used among themselves. "I told you to cut <em>green </em>branches for roasting those sausages."<br><br>"But <em>Daad," </em>the boy protested with a gap-toothed grin as he thrust his dried, burning stick over the flames among those of the older kids, "it gets done fast this way, and I like it crusty. The sticks I cut for Sarah and Melly were green, <em>ja, </em>see? For the marshmallows later I'll get me a new one."<br><br>Luke just shook his head. Little Eli always liked to turn his marshmallows into flaming torches, too. This Friday night bonfire, which drew so many of the Amish young people, was at the back lot line of the Brand farm this week, so Luke had volunteered to oversee it. Since he was a widower, the teenagers during their running-around period seemed to accept his watchful eye easier than they did that of someone with a fussing woman in tow. And the courting couples didn't mind if he brought his two kids and his brother Dan's nine-year-old daughter Melanie along. To keep out of their way as best he could, he took his sizzling sausage, thrust it into a bun smothered with onions, mustard and homemade cucumber dill pickles and went off to eat it near the edge of the cornfield where the boys had left their courting buggies.<br><br>It was a beautiful, moonlit autumn night, and Luke was glad to be doing something to keep from feeling lonely. In the five years since he'd been widowed, the nights were the hardest to get through. His family and friends had tried to pair him with some of the younger girls, since most Amish women his age were wed, but things just hadn't clicked for him, although he wasn't mourning Anna anymore.<br><br>He sighed and his shoulders slumped before he got hold of himself and remembered to stay grateful for his many blessings. The coming autumn was his favorite time of year, with warm, sunny days, cool nights, and the trees turning rich reds and golds. The vast cornfields that surrounded the farm would be ready for harvest soon, for the growing season was late this year. He could feel the first hints of crisp air clear down in his lungs when he inhaled.<br><br>But he admitted to himself that he'd like to share all that, take a walk in the woods with someone special. At least at night he was usually exhausted enough to sleep long and hard from all the work around the farm and his windmill shop.<br><br>Out here, away from big-city lights, as his brother Dan always said, the stars stood out like scattered diamonds, not that Luke, even at age thirty-two, had seen either scattered diamonds or big-city lights. Unlike Dan and others who took off for a taste of worldly life among the English in their <em>rumspringa </em>years, Luke had stayed home. He'd been happy here in Roscoe County, sure of what he wanted.<br><br>The only unexpected thing he'd ever done was start a shop, where he and a small staff made decorative windmills, as well as full-size functional ones. The church elders had held a meeting to decide about the propriety of the decorative windmills&#x2014;"just for pretty," as his wife had said. That very month, Luke had won his argument but lost his Anna in childbirth complications when she bore Sarah. Despite the fact she'd done all the prenatal visits with her doctor, her blood pressure had shot up and she'd developed eclampsia.<br><br>Luke looked at his five-year-old, blond daughter, giggling with Melanie, both of them wide-eyed over the way the courting couples held hands, stole <em>smootchs, </em>or whispered together. Sarah wore her black bonnet over her <em>kapp, </em>but Melanie, free spirit that she was, wore a Cleveland Indians baseball cap backward over her curly auburn hair. Covering her head around her father's people was some concession, Luke supposed, to her half-Amish roots, for his brother Dan had left the faith ten years ago to wed a worldly woman.<br><br>Luke heard a strange hum, a dissonant, distant sound. Even over the kids' happy voices as someone started a song, it caught his attention, like the buzzing of a wasp. Not an airplane, he assured himself, glancing skyward and walking farther from the circle of firelight. Surely not a car on the road, for the lanes to the Brand acreage, which he farmed with his brother Moses, were far enough away that the wide cornfields would mute the noise.<br><br>But the strange sound kept coming closer.<br><br>Pricking up their ears, the horses hitched to the courting buggies sidestepped and whinnied. Some sort of small motor, Luke decided, as he walked farther away from the kids to gaze down the twelve-foot-wide lane they'd left unplanted between two cornfields so they could get the combine and wagons in. Yes, he saw a single, small light coming at him down the lane, bumping through the ruts.<br><br>He shook his head. A motorbike. No doubt one of the Amish kids had rented it. Cars, motorcycles, drinking, smoking, movies, rock music and dances, even drugs on occasion&#x2014;some Amish teens tried everything before they finally committed to the church and things Amish. But he didn't need some kid full of beer turning the corner and hitting those around the fire.<br><br>Luke stepped into the middle of the lane and waved his arms, crisscrossing them slowly before his face. Like his brothers, he was tall for an Amish man, nearly six feet, but he was wearing all black and the rider evidently didn't see him.<br><br>Then he realized the biker saw him but wasn't going to stop. He wore a dark visor, like on a space helmet or one worn by some football players on TV Luke had watched in English homes or shops. And gloves&#x2014;he wore gloves.<br><br>At the last minute, Luke leaped out of the way. As the motorbike made the turn, the rider, in jeans and black leather jacket, dragged his booted foot to keep from taking a spill, then accelerated again.<br><br>Luke lunged after the bike, around the corner of the cornfield, screaming at the kids, "Look out! Look out!"<br><br>Nine-year-old Eli Brand spent a lot of his time watching his dad. He lost his mother when he was four, and he was scared he'd lose his dad, too. He watched him real careful, every time he could, especially when Dad climbed those high windmills.<br><br>Now the motorbike&#x2014;the one his dad was yelling about&#x2014;came real fast around the corner of the field.<br><br>"Look out! Look out!" Eli repeated his father's shout.<br><br>Despite being absorbed in their singing, by now the older kids had seen the bike and stood gaping at it. Eli was grateful the driver steered easily around them. But he threw something into the bonfire, right past Eli's head&#x2014;a package that exploded with noise and flames. Shrieking rockets and a blaze of color blasted sideways and skyward.<br><br>Horses shied, reared and dragged their buggies, bumping into cornstalks or each other. Kids dove for cover, running, screaming, scattering into the rows of tall corn or toward the nearby ravine.<br><br></p><h2>We Owe You Nothing, Punk Planet : The Collected Interviews</h2><p>Cultural Writing.

This atmospheric, intricate thriller, a pitch-perfect modern Gothic, chilled my blood and warmed my heart. As unforgettable as it is original (AJ Finn, author of The Woman in the Window); Elly Griffiths writes with a sharp, smart eye and great elegance. This novel is compelling, intelligent and increasingly mesmerising (Peter James); My heart is still pounding after finishing Elly Griffiths&#39; The Stranger Diaries. As with her other books, this is fiercely intelligent, warm, human and at times, funny. The Stranger Diaries picks up where the great Gothic thrillers of the past leave off. At once a homage to that great literary form, and a re-imagining, it is goose-bump spooky, smart, and haunting, in every sense. I loved this book! And you will too (Louise Penny); A deviously plotted modern-day tale that&#39;s rooted in a flesh-creeping Victorian past. Elly Griffiths&#39; clever and original murder mystery plays deliciously on the nerves and kept me guessing until the end (Lesley Thomson, author of The Detective&#39;s Daughter series); A beautifully turned chiller (Mail on Sunday); Written with Griffiths&#39;s usual warmth and lightness of touch but has a genuine creepiness that gets under your skin (Sunday Express); The perfect page-turner for foggy, wintry evenings (Sun); A splendidly creepy Gothic tale . Cliffhangers and Gothic tropes abound (Guardian); An atmospheric coastal setting, more than a dash of the supernatural - a love letter to Gothic ficiton. Perfect winter read (Sunday Mirror).

Part I deals at some length with the central musical language of the 15th and 16th centuries, which was developed in France, Italy, and the Low Countries, while Part II deals primarily with the music of other lands. This distinction has nothing to do with the comparative intrinsic merit of the various bodies of music, but only with the separation of local dialects from the central language. Indeed, such local productions as the 16th-century music of Spain and England provide artistic expressions quite in a class with the best music of France, Italy, and the Low Countries. The method of first taking into account only the central language has the advantage of permitting the main technical developments of the centuries under consideration to be described, as it were, in a straight line. Thereafter, the entire period is traversed again for each country dealt with in Part II. As a result, the same musical forms and processes of composition are treated several times, but each discussion is entered from a different approach and with the admixture of something individual&#x2015;that is, national. The method offers advantages not only to the one whose task it is to sort out a huge amount of varied material, but also to the one who studies it: the student has the main historical outline presented to him more than once, but each time with important changes in the details by which it is filled in.</p><p></p><h2>About Face</h2><p>"Michaels is at her storytelling best here." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><b><br><br>About Face</b><br><br>When Dr. Blake Hunter discovers Casey Edwards wandering along a Sweetwater, Georgia, road, she's a woman without a past, her memory stripped of the terrifying events that shattered her innocence a decade ago.

M.B.K. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>For Adam&#39;s Sake: A Family Saga in Colonial New England</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;A work of astonishing ingenuity, intellectual and emotional depth, and (most of all) brilliant writing.&#x201d;&#x2015;John Demos, author of <em>The Unredeemed Captive</em></strong></p> In the tradition of Laurel Thatcher Ulrich&#x2019;s classic, <em>A Midwife&#x2019;s Tale</em>, comes this groundbreaking narrative by one of America&#x2019;s most promising colonial historians. Joshua Hempstead was a well-respected farmer and tradesman in New London, Connecticut. As his remarkable diary&#x2015;kept from 1711 until 1758&#x2015;reveals, he was also a slave owner who owned Adam Jackson for over thirty years. In this engrossing narrative of family life and the slave experience in the colonial North, Allegra di Bonaventura describes the complexity of this master/slave relationship and traces the intertwining stories of two families until the eve of the Revolution. Slavery is often left out of our collective memory of New England&#x2019;s history, but it was hugely impactful on the central unit of colonial life: the family. In every corner, the lines between slavery and freedom were blurred as families across the social spectrum fought to survive. In this enlightening study, a new portrait of an era emerges. 16 pages of illustrations; 2 maps</p><p>Allegra di Bonaventura is the associate director of graduate programs at Yale Law School. She received a PhD from Yale University and a JD from Yale Law School. She is the author of For Adam&#x2019;s Sake, which was awarded the New England Historical Association James P. Hanlan Book Award and named one of the best books of 2013 by the Wall Street Journal.&#x201c;This is an extraordinary story about ordinary people in a pre-revolutionary New England family. Among the people are a master and his slave, the only account of such psychological depth I have seen in all the family histories of New England. Impeccably researched, elegantly written, <em>For Adams' Sake</em> is a model of its kind.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Joseph Ellis, author of <i>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A work of astonishing ingenuity, intellectual and emotional depth, and (most of all) brilliant writing.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Demos, author of <i>The Unredeemed Captive: A Family Story from Early America</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>For Adam's Sake</em> achieves an amazing, seemingly impossible conjunction&#x2015;the best book ever on New England family life and the best book ever on the family context of American slavery, neither pretty&#x2015;a riveting story and great history based on astounding research.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jon Butler, author of <i>Becoming America: The Revolution Before 1776</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Engrossing...

Allegra di Bonaventura&#x2019;s rich account complicates the traditional narrative of slavery and race in early America, showing the ways in which the peculiar institution was woven into the fabric of life in parts of New England.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Annette Gordon-Reed, author of <i>The Hemingses of Monticello</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In <em>For Adam&#x2019;s Sake</em>, Allegra di Bonaventura has painted a rich canvas of the eighteenth-century town of New London, Connecticut. In the foreground are Adam Jackson, a slave, and Joshua Hempstead, his owner. For the title, the author pays tribute to Adam and to all the other bondsmen of early New England.

Centering her study on the port town of New London, Connecticut, and building on the diary of shipwright, yeoman farmer, and community leader Joshua Hempstead, <em>For Adams's Sake</em> traces the entangled histories of New Englanders&#x2015;prominent and marginal, free and enslaved&#x2015;across the generations. With deep research and scrupulous fidelity to her sources, Di Bonaventura enables us to hear the voices of her subjects and glimpse the rhythms and ruptures that defined a world we thought we had lost.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Peter Onuf, Senior Research Fellow, Robert H.

Featuring more than 500 full-color illustrations and photographs, along with detailed annotations, Dorling Kindersley Handbooks make identification easy and accurate.</p></p><p>David Carter is an entomologist at the Natural History Museum, London, where he has worked for nearly 40 years specializing in Lepidoptera. At the museum, he has also managed part of the vast National Collection of World Insects. His many books on the subject include the Observer&#39;s Book of Caterpillars, Butterflies and Moths in Britain and Europe, The Photographic Guide to Identifying Butterflies, and the Collins Field Guide to Caterpillars of Britain and Europe. He has also produced technical manuals such as Pest Lepidoptera of Europe and Care and Conservation of Natural History Collections, as well as many scientific papers. David lives with his wife Brenda in Surrey, England. They have four grown-up children.With crisp illustrations and graphic presentations characteristic of Dorling Kindersley book design, these identification guides differ somewhat from other standard field guides by using a narrowing-down process that moves through several stages to identify specimens based upon such observable characteristics as shape, color, range, and so forth. Each book opens with a short section on how to collect and classify specimens. These chapters review tools, discuss collecting "ethics," and describe procedures for documenting a collection. The bulk of each handbook consists of illustrated entries summarizing facts about the particular specimen. For minerals and rocks, entries list facts such as composition, group type, descriptions of how the material is formed, chemical or physical composition, and how the material's hardness or chemistry can be tested. The shell handbook identifies the organism by family and species, indicates habitat and geographic distribution, and gives typical dimension. Moths and butterflies are identified by family and species, habitat, time of day when usually in flight, and typical size. Each entry contains a full-color illustration. Butterflies and Moths occasionally offers pictures of both male and female when the species show significant differences in markings between sexes. Public libraries should find that these handsome volumes are worth adding to their collections of field identification guides. They may even want to purchase two sets: the hardcover for their reference collection and the flexibound for their circulating collection.-- Laurie Tynan, Montgomery Cty.<br><i>Norristown P.L., Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Conan the Adventurer</h2><p>Rarely found, good condition</p><p></p><h2>Taking on the World: Joseph and Stewart Alsop, Guardians of the American Century</h2><p>Traces the careers of journalists and columnists Joseph and Stewart Alsop, who, through their uncontested ascendence among the Washington press corps and high society, influenced the course of the Cold War. 20,000 first printing. $20,000 ad/promo. Tour.</p><p>Through journals like &#34;The Saturday Evening Post,&#34; &#34;The New York Herald Tribune,&#34; and &#34;Newsweek,&#34; journalists Joseph (1910-1989) and Stewart (1914-1974) Alsop espoused militant anticommunism and a robust vision of America as the world&#39;s legitimate leader. They enjoyed greater influence than most journalists, having unequaled access to presidents from Truman to Carter, and especially Kennedy, whom they advised on sweeping matters of state. Together, this journalistic tag team redefined the role of the media in American politics. Those who complain that the so-called liberal news media enjoy too much power today ought to take note that the way was paved by these archconservatives.

HEALTH Autistic spectrum disorders continue to be a major topic in the news. This mysterious group of developmental disorders still has no known cause, but those who have them seem to have a high incidence of digestive problems. Dietary interventions often lead to improved functioning. These three books offer information about diets and recipes that appeal to children. Strickland, a registered dietitian specializing in ADHD and autism, offers the most detail, explaining the importance of good nutrition for development and discussing food allergies and the use of special diets, vitamins, and supplements. Compart, a developmental pediatrician and Laake, a registered dietitian, cover the gluten-free, casein-free diet and its use in treating both ADHD and autism. They explain what the diet is, why it works, and how to transition a child onto it. Kid-friendly recipes make up the book&#x2019;s core. There is also a resource list. Kessick, a British autism advocate who has an autistic son, presents the shortest book, which features a brief history of dietary intervention in treating autism and material on the implementation of a special diet at home and at school.

His books include <i>The Kinks: The Official Biography </i>and <i>Time Travel,</i> a collection of articles. He lives in West London.<br>In an account packed with incisive social analysis, a London- based writer who contributes regularly to US music magazines (Spin, Rolling Stone, etc.) chronicles the lurid yet surprisingly complex rise and fall of Britain's quintessential punk band, the Sex Pistols. Taking his title from the lyrics of the band's ``God Save the Queen'' (``There is no future, in England's dreaming. No future for you, no future for me''), Savage begins with a long description of the nihilistic, in-your-face fashion world in which Malcolm McLaren, the group's manager, got his start. These first pages are decidedly slow, but they are the only slow ones in a long book that--among countless other things--describes McLaren's apparently seething, opportunistic ambition, and the ``miasma'' of violence that followed the Sex Pistols from an early, foulmouthed TV interview to a gruesome tour across America's South (recounted by Noel E. Monk and Jimmy Guterman in 12 Days on the Road, 1990) and the drug-induced death of bass player Sid Vicious. Throughout, Savage provides much intriguing background information, especially about the suffocating nature of recession-hit 1970's England, along with illuminating quotes from dozens of sources. His narrative is filled with pithy insights that keep their appropriate punch even when wallowing in verbosity (``The very English phlegm which had served as a powerful psychological metaphor for denial...was now, literally, expelled in torrents as...Punk audiences covered their object of desire with sheets of saliva''). Though at times overly detailed and wordy, still a compelling and intelligent narrative that's as much about the nature of anarchy as about the Sex Pistols and punk rock.

Great, creepy stuff.&#x201d; &#x2013; Stephen King</p> <p><br> -The story of one of America's most notorious killers is revealed in this true-crime comic unlike any other!&nbsp;<em>Green River Killer</em>&nbsp;tells the story of a historical manhunt, and a compelling family saga.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the 1980s, the highest priority of Seattle-area police was the apprehension of the Green River Killer, the man responsible for the murders of dozens of women. But in 1990, with the body count numbering at least forty-eight, the case was put in the hands of a single detective, Tom Jensen. After twenty years, when the killer was finally captured with the help of DNA technology, Jensen and fellow detectives spent 188 days interviewing Gary Leon Ridgway in an effort to learn his most closely held secrets-an epic confrontation with evil that proved as disturbing and surreal as can be imagined.

"Miss, who's that funny man at the back of the classroom?" So begins school-inspector Gervase Phinn's second year among the frankly spoken pupils and teachers of North Yorkshire&#x2014;the sight of Gervase with his notebook and pen provokes unexpected reactions from the children and adults alike. But Gervase is far from daunted&#x2014;he is ready to brave the steely glare of the officious Mrs. Savage, and even feels up to helping Dr. Gore organize a gathering of the Feofees&#x2014;just as soon as someone tells him what they are! He is still in pursuit of the lovely head teacher Christine Bentley, but will she feel the same? This is a delectable second helping of hilarious tales from the man who has been dubbed "the James Herriot of schools." In <i>Over Hill and Dale</i>, Gervase Phinn will have you laughing out loud.</p><p><p><b>Gervase Phinn </b>is a teacher, freelance lecturer, author, poet, school inspector, educational consultant, and visiting professor of education. For 14 years he taught in a range of schools, then acted as general advisor for language development in Rotherham before moving on to North Yorkshire, where he spent 10 years as a school inspector&#x2014;time that has provided so much source material for his books. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and an Honorary Fellow of St John's College, York.</p>Dr Gore, Chief Education Officer for the county of Yorkshire, smiled like a hungry vampire, the sort of thin-lipped, self-satisfied smile of Count Dracula before he sinks his fangs into a helpless victim.<p>&#x2018;And how are you, Gervase?&#x2019; he mouthed softly, showing a glimpse of teeth.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh ... er ... very well thank you, Dr Gore,&#x2019; I replied, attempting to sound cheerful and relaxed.</p><p>&#x2018;Good, good,&#x2019; the CEO murmured. He stared for a moment over the top of his small, gold-framed spectacles and then, resting his elbows on the large mahogany desk in front of him, steepled his long fingers and nodded thoughtfully. &#x2018;And how have you found your first year with us in Yorkshire?&#x2019; he asked. His voice was soft as the summer breeze.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh ... er ... very well, thank you, Dr Gore,&#x2019; I replied for the second time and shifted nervously in the chair. He continued to smile and steeple his long fingers without saying a word. In the embarrassed silence which followed I heard the slow ticking of the clock on the wall, squeaking footsteps in the corridor outside, the distant hum of traffic on the High Street and a slight buzzing of a faulty fluorescent light in the outer office. &#x2018;I think, well, quite good actually, quite successful ...&#x2019; my voice trailed off. I sounded incredibly inarticulate for the County Inspector of Schools for English and Drama. &#x2018;Not too bad,&#x2019; I said finally.</p><p>&#x2018;Good, good,&#x2019; the CEO said almost in a whisper. &#x2018;I expect you are wondering why I sent for you so early in the new academic year?&#x2019; he continued, smiling and steepling.</p><p>&#x2018;Yes, I was wondering,&#x2019; I replied nervously.</p><p>The morning had started off so well. I had arrived at the Education Office in Fettlesham that first day of the new term, bright and early and keen to be back at work. A warm September sun had shone in a cloudless sky, the air had been fresh and still, the birds singing and everything had seemed right with the world. Over the summer break, while the schools had been on holiday, I had managed to clear my desk of the mountain of paperwork. Reports had been completed, guidelines written, courses planned, correspondence dealt with and documents had been filed away neatly. I had surveyed the empty desk with a sense of real satisfaction and achievement.</p><p>It had been a fascinating first year, occasionally exhausting and frustrating, but for most of the time full of variety and challenge. The colleagues with whom I worked and shared an office had been immensely supportive during my induction into the profession of school inspector. There was Dr Harold Yates, the Senior Inspector, Sidney Clamp, the unpredictable and larger-than-life creative and visual arts inspector and David Pritchard, the small, good-humoured Welshman responsible for mathematics, PE and games. We got on well together and were supported and kept in order by Julie the inspectors&#x2019; secretary.</p><p>That first year, I had worked alongside teachers in the classroom, organised courses and conferences, directed workshops, rum seminars, and attended governors&#x2019; meetings and appointment panels. The most interesting part of the job, however, had involved visiting the small rural primary schools in the heart of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales, to spend a morning or an afternoon observing lessons, looking at the children&#x2019;s work and reporting on the quality of the teaching and the learning.</p><p>As I sat at my empty desk, thinking about the quiet, uneventful, stress-free day ahead of me, I heard a clattering on the stairs, telling me that a moment later Julie would totter in on those absurdly high-heeled shoes shoe was so found of wearing. In my first year Julie had been invaluable. Not only was she very efficient, good-humoured and extremely comical. She had those qualities often possessed by Yorkshire people &#x2013; generous to a fault, hard-working but with a blunt nature and a fierce honesty, characteristics which often got her into trouble. With her bright bubbly blonde hair and bright bubbly nature, Julie was a breath of fresh air in the drab and cramped office. That morning she struggled into the room, breathing heavily and loaded down with assorted bags, papers and files. I jumped up to help her.</p><p>&#x2018;I feel like some sort of peripatetic car boot sale!&#x2019; she cried, dropping her load noisily on the nearest desk. Before I could open my mouth she continued, &#x2018;I started off with a handbag and a bit of shopping but collected all this little lot on my way from the bus stop. As I was passing committee Room 1, Debbie &#x2013; you know, the big woman with the peroxide hair who always wears those awful pink knitted outfits &#x2013; asked me to take Mr Pritchard&#x2019;s briefcase which he left there last term. Forget his head if it wasn&#x2019;t screwed on. I mean, that briefcase has been there for six weeks. It wouldn&#x2019;t have done Debbie any harm to bring the briefcase up herself. The climb up the stairs would have given her a bit of exercise. She could do with losing a few pounds. Anyway, when I got to the Post Room that Derek &#x2013; you know, the gangly lad with the spectacles and big ears &#x2013; asked me to pick up the inspectors&#x2019; mail since I was going that way anyway, Then I had these confidential staffing files pushed into my hands when I reached Personnel. They weigh a ton. I don&#x2019;t know why Dr Yeats didn&#x2019;t pick them up himself. I must have looked like an old pack horse, stumbling along the corridors on County Hall.&#x2019; She shook her head and breathed out heavily. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m too good natured by half, that&#x2019;s my trouble. And I&#x2019;ve snagged a nail.&#x2019; She began to root about in her handbag and continued chattering on without pausing. &#x2018;Anyway, how are you?&#x2019; I attempted a response but without success. &#x2018;I had a nail file in here somewhere, I&#x2019;m sure I did,&#x2019; she continued. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know about you, but I could murder a strong cup of coffee.&#x2019; Without waiting for an answer she disappeared out of the room.</p><p>&#x2018;Good morning Julie!&#x2019; I shouted after her, at last getting a word in. I thought of the wonderfully descriptive and rather unkind Yorkshire expression to describe a person, just like Julie, who so enjoys talking about anything everything that it becomes almost a running commentary: &#x2018;She&#x2019;s got a runaway gob &#x2013; talks and says nowt and she&#x2019;s said nowt when she&#x2019;s done.&#x2019;</p><p>A few minutes later, when I was sorting through my mail, Julie returned with two steaming mugs. I watched as she set one mug down on my desk and cupped her hands around the other.</p><p>&#x2018;you&#x2019;re very quiet today,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;Is something wrong?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Nothing at all Julie,&#x2019; I replied amiably, putting my letters into the in-tray on my desk. Then I asked a question which I immediately regretted. &#x2018;How was your holiday?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;don&#x2019;t ask!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not too good then?&#x2019; I hazarded, looking up and reaching for the coffee.</p><p>&#x2018;Awful! I went to Majorca with my boyfriend. It took months to persuade him, because Paul&#x2019;s about as adventurous as a dead sheep when it comes to holidays and, of course, his mother has to put her two pennyworth in about foreign food, plane crashes and hijackers. Anyway, the flight was delayed so we had a four-hour wait at Manchester Airport with him moaning and groaning. Then I was stopped at customs by a horrible little man in black. I got Spanish tummy the day after I arrived and Paul fell asleep in the sun and woke up like a lobster with an attitude problem. The he came out in blisters the size of balloons and wouldn&#x2019;t leave the room. He said he looked like something out of a horror film and when I agreed he didn&#x2019;t speak to me for two days. The hotel was only half built and the pool was full of spoilt, screaming children. We had karaoke every night until two in the morning with a tone-deaf Dutchman singing &#x201c;I did it my way&#x201d; at the top of his voice and a woman from Dudley who sounded like a sheep about to give birth. And if you got down after eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning you could say goodbye to the sunbeds. We&#x2019;ll go to Skegness next year in his auntie&#x2019;s caravan. Anyway, what was your holiday like?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, very restful,&#x2019; I told her. &#x2018;I managed to get away for a few days and &#x2013;&#x2018;</p><p>before I could elaborate, Julie dived in with her characteristic bluntness. &#x2018;And did you see much of that sexy teacher you were taking out?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Unfortunately, not a great deal,&#x2019; I replied smiling and thinking of what Christine&#x2019;s reaction would be to Julie&#x2019;s comment about her.</p><p>I had met Christine almost exactly a year earlier when I had visited the infant school where she was the Headteacher. She had appeared like some vision and I had been bowled over by those large blue eyes, warm smile, fair complexion and soft mass of golden hair. After a long period spent summoning up the courage and with constant nagging from my colleagues in the office, I had asked her out. We had been to the theatre and the cinema, to a concert and various school events and as each day passed I felt sure I was falling in love with her.</p><p>When I had first met Christine she had had a boyfriend &#x2013; miles. He was everything I was not; strikingly handsome, with the sort of sculptured features of a male model. He was lean, athletic, sophisticated and suave and he was also very wealthy. But Miles had those flaws of character often possessed by men who are rich and handsome: he was arrogant and self-centred. To my delight, Christine had, in Sidney&#x2019;s words, &#x2018;given him the old heave-ho&#x2019;, which was when I had chanced my arm and asked her out. Over the recent summer holidays I had not seen very much of her. She had spent three weeks in Chicago, staying with a cousin and a further week writing up a dissertation for a masters degree. We had enjoyed a day walking on the North York moors and been to the theatre and out to dinner a couple of times. This term I was determined, I was going to see a whole lot more of her.</p><p>&#x2018;So what&#x2019;s happening with you two then?&#x2019; asked Julie. She was not one to beat around the bush.</p><p>&#x2018;what do you mean, what&#x2019;s happening?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Well, are you getting it together? Is it serious?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m not sure ... &#x2018; I started.</p><p>Julie folded her arms and pulled a face. &#x2018;Typical of men that &#x2013; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x201d; Just like Paul.&#x2019; She put on a sort of whining voice. &#x2018;&#x201d;I&#x2019;m not sure about going to Majorca, I&#x2019;m not sure that this is the right flight, I&#x2019;m not sure I&#x2019;ll like this Spanish food, I&#x2019;m not sure &#x2013;&#x201c;&#x2019;</p><p>I decided to change the subject. &#x2018;Am I the only one in the office this morning?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s always the woman who has to make the decisions. What did you say?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I asked if I was the only one in the office this morning?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Just you. Mr Clamp&#x2019;s planning his art course, Mr Pritchard&#x2019;s meeting with the newly qualified teachers and Dr Yeats is at a conference. There&#x2019;s not much mail either, by the look of it.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;So,&#x2019; I said happily, &#x2018;it looks like a quiet start to the term.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not necessarily,&#x2019; said Julie. &#x2018;Mrs Savage phoned last Friday.&#x2019; At this point her lip curled like a rabid dog and her voice became hard-edged. &#x2018;She wondered where you were. I said, &#x201c;People do take holidays, you know.&#x201d; If she&#x2019;d have bothered to look at those wretched inspectors&#x2019; engagement sheets I have to send over to Admin. every week she&#x2019;d have seen that you were on leave. She just like the sound of her own voice and it&#x2019;s not her real voice anyway. She puts it on. I don&#x2019;t know who she thinks she&#x2019;s trying to impress.&#x2019;</p><p>I began to chuckle and shake my head. &#x2018;You&#x2019;ve really got it in for Mrs Savage this morning, Julie, and no mistake. She&#x2019;s not that bad.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;she&#x2019;s <i>unbearable</i>. &#x201c;Ho,&#x201d; says she, &#x201c;well tell Mr Phinn, when he returns, that Dr gore wishes to see him in his room has a metter of hurgency at nine hey hem prompt.&#x201d; Made you sound like a naughty schoolboy. Then she slams the phone down with no trace of a &#x201c;please&#x201d; or &#x201c;thank you&#x201d;.&#x2019; Julie&#x2019;s face screwed up as if she had chronic indigestion. &#x2018;That awful voice of hers really gets under my skin.&#x2019;</p><p>Mrs Savage, the CEO&#x2019;s personal assistant, was not the most popular of people in our office nor was she the easiest woman to get on with. She had a formidable reputation with a sharp tongue and a stare that could curdle milk; she definitely was not a person with whom to cross swords. I had kept a wary distance after battling with her the previous year.</p><p>&#x2018;And speaking of getting under people&#x2019;s skin,&#x2019; said Julie, &#x2018;I reckon she&#x2019;s had her face done.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who?&#x2019; I asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Mrs Savage. When I saw her last week in the staff canteen I didn&#x2019;t recognise her. Her skin&#x2019;s been stretched right back off her face. She looks as if she&#x2019;s walking through a wind tunnel. All those wrinkles have disappeared. And she did have some lines on her face, didn&#x2019;t she? Looked like something out of that shop in the High Street where they sell all those wrinkled leather coats. Those two pouches under her chin have gone as well.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t remember her having pouches.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Of course you do! She looked like a gerbil with mumps. And I think she&#x2019;s had the rhinosuction because she looks a lot thinner as well.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Liposuction,&#x2019; I corrected her.</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s that thick-skinned, I think I was right the first time. She gave me such a glare, I can tell you, if looks could maim, I&#x2019;d be on crutches.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;And she said Dr Gore wanted to see me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s unbearable that woman,&#x2019; said Julie with venom, &#x2018;you would think &#x2013;&#x2018;</p><p>&#x2018;Julie!&#x2019; I snapped. &#x2018;Did Mrs Savage say that Dr Gore wanted to see me?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;At nine o&#x2019;clock prompt. That&#x2019;s what Lady high and Mighty said.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I wonder what it&#x2019;s about?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;She puts on that posh accent and that hoity-toity manner but it doesn&#x2019;t fool me. Marlene on the switchboard remembers her when she started as an office junior. That&#x2019;s when her hair colour was natural. She had a voice as broad as a barn door and as croaky as a frog with laryngitis.

There had been the county-wide reading survey and the full audit of secondary school libraries followed by a detailed report to the Education Committee.

I've never volunteered to save humpback whales or the rain forest. I've never been to protest rallies, fed the hungry in Africa, or righted any of the eighty thousand things that are wrong with the world these days. Heroism isn't a trait commonly found in teenage boys.</p> <p>Stupidity though? We've got that in spades.</p> <p>Stupidity is why I'm huddled behind a large sofa bed, underneath a heavy blanket, drenched in my own sweat despite the AC humming in what is otherwise silence. The television is tuned to the least scary show I could find: a Jersey Shore rerun-horrifying in its own way, but not in the way that matters, which is the most important thing. I stare at the TV screen-and not because I'm eagerly awaiting Snooki's next freak-out. I watch the screen because I want to know when it's coming to find me.</p> <p>Earlier this evening, I'd taken a raggedy-looking doll-its cotton stuffing already scooped out-and replaced it with uncooked rice and a few fingernail clippings. And I'd sewed it up with red thread. When you've done this as many times as I have, sewing becomes as good a weapon as any. Then I waited for three a.m. to roll around before filling the tub with water and dropping the doll in the bath.</p> <p>"Dumbelina, you're it."</p> <p>The name was not my idea, but it was what I had to work with. Using the same name that Sondheim and his girlfriend used in the ritual they started and never finished-that's how it knows you're singling it out. Just to ensure there were no misunderstandings, I said "You're it" two more times.</p> <p>The doll, like most dolls, said nothing. It gazed up at me from beneath the water, a drowned, ball-jointed Ophelia with synthetic brown hair and plastic eyes in a yellow broadcloth dress made in some sweatshop in China. The doll was common enough, the kind that could have been a knockoff of a knockoff.</p> <p>The air changes. Then that invisible spider crawls up my spine, tickling the hairs behind my neck. I have come to know this spider these last couple of years. It whispers there's something else in the room, breathing with you, watching you, grinning at you.</p> <p>I hate that damn spider.</p> <p>For one moment, the doll's stringy brown hair glitters a shiny black under the fluorescent lights. For one moment, the doll's glassy gaze takes on the faintest tinge of malicious self-awareness. For one moment, that thing's head breaks through the water's surface and looks at me.</p> <p>I switch off the lights. I back out of the bathroom and close the door. I hide.</p> <p>It sounds pretty idiotic, playing hide-and-seek with a doll. It's not. It's part of the rules I gotta play by.</p> <p>The first rule is this: I have to finish the game. No matter what happens.</p> <p>I've taken a mouthful of salt water at this point, and I begin counting in my head. One thousand and one, one thousand and two, one thousand and three, one thousand and four...</p> <p>On the TV screen, an orange-skinned, heavily built Italian guy with gravity-defying hair is arguing with another orange-skinned, heavily built Italian guy with gravity-defying hair.</p> <p>...one thousand and five, one thousand and six, one thousand and seven...</p> <p>I briefly wonder where Ki is. She's often been quick to turn up when I've done other harebrained rituals like this one. At the moment, she's nowhere to be seen, which worries me. It's not like she's got something else to do.</p> <p>I'm no hero, but I do have a superpower. Except my superpower tends to wander off when she's bored.</p> <p>...one thousand and eight, one thousand and nine...</p> <p>The noise of the television fizzles out. Then the sound returns, but it's warped, like an inexperienced DJ is spinning on a broken turntable and he has the song stuck on repeat. The voices drop several octaves until they're rough and scratchy and incomprehensible. Jersey Shore switches to static.</p> <p>Immediately, my gaze swings back toward the bathroom door, which is standing wide open.</p> <p>I'm pretty sure I closed it.</p> <p>Something is moving around the room. I'm hoping it's Okiku, but I doubt it.</p> <p>It sounds like something is dragging itself across the floor. Like it isn't quite sure how to use its legs properly yet.</p> <p>I risk another glance over the sofa bed.</p> <p>Wet tracks lead away from the bathroom, water stains seeping into the carpet. The television screen is blank, though the disturbing noises continue.</p> <p>And then I see the doll lying facedown in a puddle of water several feet from where I am.</p> <p>I retreat back into my blanket fortress to retrieve a plastic cup half-filled with the same saltwater mix that is in my mouth. I also pick up a small paring knife. Then I emerge from my hiding place, peering nervously up over the sofa again...</p> <p>...and I come face-to-face with the doll, which is perched atop it. It has a small, peculiar, black gash across its face, which on a person would have been a mouth.</p> <p>The doll in the bathtub didn't have a mouth.</p> <p>It lunges.</p> <p>I duck.</p> <p>It sails over my head and crashes into a painting behind me. I have enough presence of mind not to swallow the salt water or spit it out. I don't waste precious seconds looking behind me-I make for the closet, my backup hiding place in case anything went wrong, which it almost always did.</p> <p>I slip in and slide the door shut behind me, wriggling in among the clothes and shoes, trying to make as little sound as I can. You don't need to find the most complicated hiding spot when a ghost is hunting you. The instant you trap them inside a vessel, like a doll's body, their perception of the world becomes limited.</p> <p>I wait for several long seconds. Everything's quiet, but I'm not buying it. If you move when they're there to see, they'll find you. They'll find you fast.</p> <p>Through the small slits of light coming in through the slatted closet door, I make out a movement. Then I catch a glimpse of yellow as something small and decidedly doll-shaped shuffles into view.</p> <p>It's crawling on its hands and knees.</p> <p>Its every movement sounds like crunching bone.</p> <p>It's searching for me.</p> <p>I hold my breath and wait until it twitches away.</p> <p>The second rule of the game: it gets to look for me first. Then it's my turn. We swap roles every few minutes until someone succeeds. First one to stab three times doesn't get to die.</p> <p>Time's up.</p> <p>I count another ten seconds, because starting my turn late is better than starting it too early, while it's still on the hunt. Then I step out, curbing the desire to take the coward's route and hide 'til morning. Or better yet, to race out of the apartment screaming like a little kid.</p> <p>The doll lies flat on its back, its midnight-black eyes boring through the ceiling. It isn't moving.</p> <p>I run toward it, knife raised and ready, because the rules say I have two minutes, but experience says these bastards cheat. When it comes to dealing with ghosts, the general consensus is to hit first and hit hard, because chances are you'll be dead before you can get off a second attempt.</p> <p>I strike. My knife finds its mark, plunging into the doll's chest. I spit the salt water that's in my mouth onto the doll, soaking its cotton dress. "I win!" I sputter and then rip the knife free so I can stab it again.</p> <p>The television chooses that moment to flicker back on. Momentarily distracted, I glance at the screen. The two guys are still arguing. When I look back down, the doll is nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Crap.</p> <p>Trying not to panic, I search the room as quickly and as thoroughly as I can. I check under the couch, the bed, even take another quick look inside the bathroom. Nothing.</p> <p>A drop of water landing on the carpet in front of me is the only warning I get. I have just enough time to look up as the doll bears down on me from the ceiling. Its mouth is too big for its face with rows of jagged-looking teeth and its eyes a terrifying window of hate. The two thoughts that immediately come to mind are uh-oh and damn it.</p> <p>Ever had a possessed doll slam itself into your face at Mach 2 speed? It's like getting hit by a carnivorous chicken. I crash to the floor, the doll still clinging to me, jaws snapping at my cheek. I grab it by the scruff of its neck as I cry out in pain. I force it away, putting myself out of reach of those canines. What I don't expect is for the doll's neck to extend several inches from its body, still gunning for skin.</p> <p>"SON OF A-"</p> <p>I hurl the doll across the room. It hits the wall and flops onto the floor.</p> <p>Something's wrong. After that first stab, it shouldn't be able to move, much less attack me like it's rabid. And the last thing I want is to get bitten.</p> <p>The third and final rule of the game is this: don't lose. I'm not entirely sure what would happen if I did, but I don't want to find out. I've tagged it once and been tagged once. Not good odds.</p> <p>A loud, ripping sound screams through the doll, which twists and writhes on the floor.</p> <p>Its dress bunches up, something shifting underneath the cloth. I can see the red threads unraveling, stitch by painstaking stitch. I leap forward, burying the knife once more into that writhing mass. The doll falls limp.</p> <p>"I win!"</p> <p>But when I raise my hand again to deliver the third and final blow, the doll's body tears open. A hand bursts from the center of its chest to grab at my wrist. The hand is followed by a yellowed arm and shoulder. Another hand forces its way out, and then another, and then several more.</p> <p>Finally, a head leers out of the tattered doll's remains. A horribly disfigured face sits atop a form that isn't so much an actual body as it is a confusing protrusion of arms.</p> <p>It wails-a mewling, yowling sound-and reaches for me again.</p> <p>I've never punched a woman before-dead or alive-but this feels like the time to be misogynistic. The creature reels back, loosening its hold, and I scramble backward. It crawls toward me again, and I kick it right in the jaw. I need another stab with the knife to end the ritual, but I'm not entirely sure how to keep it still long enough to do so without getting my own limbs chewed off.</p> <p>Then something falls from the ceiling, and the creature is pinned underneath two pale hands, which would be slim and lovely if they didn't look like they've been decomposing underground for the last few centuries.</p> <p>"Okiku!" I gasp.</p> <p>There are similarities between my Okiku and the many-armed woman, in that they are both (a) dead, and (b) bloodthirsty when they've got a target in mind.</p> <p>From behind her curtain of hair, Okiku looks almost quizzical. Her hands are steel vises, fueled by three hundred years of old grudges and tempered by her surprising fondness for me. Nothing the other creature attempts could dislodge her.</p> <p>"Thanks." I pant, taking aim and driving the knife one final time into the point where the seven-armed woman's neck is joined to the rest of her, and then I brace myself.</p> <p>"I win!"</p> <p>The most horrible earsplitting wail I've ever heard rends the air, and the ghoul explodes.</p> <p>I hit the ground, covering the back of my head with my hands, more from the force of the impact than from instinct. The wailing peters out, and I take that as a sign to lift myself up and assess the carnage.</p> <p>The blast has shattered a small art-nouveau lamp, a Waterford vase, and the drooping clump of chrysanthemums that had been cowering inside it. A thick cloud of dust settles onto the floor and over the furniture, but all that's left of the creature is the ruined doll. Its black eyes are as creepy as ever, but at least its slit-mouth is gone.</p> <p>I've read about hoso-de before. Generally, these benign spirits, characterized by multiple arms, are found in most Japanese households. Why it was so angry and what it was doing in the good old U.S. of A., I have no idea. Perhaps there's a foreign neighbor in this apartment block. People always bring their ghosts with them, holding on to them like faded photographs.</p> <p>Okiku, naturally, sits in the center of the whole mess, impassioned as always, with broken remnants of the fight strewn around her like a dirty halo.</p> <p>"I hope Sondheim's not expecting me to pay for this," I mutter, standing and trying to shake the sawdust from my hair. My spirit companion says nothing. Okiku never says much, never gives any indication of what she's thinking. I'm almost used to that by now. I ramble enough for both of us.</p> <p>Okiku drifts over to me and places a finger against my cheek where the hoso-de scored a bite, the way Okiku always does when she wants to know if I'm all right. Which is rather nice of her. Up close, her face is the stuff of nightmares, an amalgamation of what it's like to be alive and dead all at once.</p> <p>I'm almost used to that too.</p> <p>"Never been better." I grin, trying to hide my shaking knees.</p> <p>This was not the first attempt at exorcising ghosts for either one of us. Over the last year, I've gone against faceless women, disfigured spirits, and grotesque revenants. Some people have dangerous hobbies, like skydiving and driving in monster truck rallies and glacier surfing. Me? I cast my soul into the churning waters of potential damnation and wait for a bite. And Okiku's been doing this for three hundred frigging years?</p> <p>Just to err on the safe side, I pour the rest of the salt water onto the doll's remains and sweep them into a large garbage bag. Okiku watches me but doesn't help. From the books Kagura lent me, I know the hoso-de are creatures of wood. Spirits of water, like Okiku, can't touch their vessels without having their own strength sapped. Fortunately, the fight didn't last long enough to weaken her.</p> <p>I turn off the TV, then paw through the blankets to find my cell phone and punch in a few numbers. "It's done," I say as soon as Sondheim answers.</p> <p>I don't have to wait long. Andy Sondheim plays wide receiver for Pembrooke High's football team and is so far up the social ladder from me that it's like trying to scale Mount Everest. With him is his perky cheerleader girlfriend, Trish Seyfried, though she's not quite so perky at the moment. Sondheim likes to boast about having his own place, even though his parents pay the rent. They're away on enough business trips that I suppose it's almost true.</p> <p>He and Trish are fully dressed now. I'd assumed they'd just gotten back from some party and were making out before they'd called. Both are still white-faced and trembling, which I'll admit I enjoy, because when he's not in fear for his life, Sondheim's usually a jerk.</p> <p>Okiku ignores them. She's been counting tiles on the floor, black hair flapping behind her like a bird's wing. Neither Sondheim nor Trish sees her. Most usually don't.</p> <p>"It's gone," I tell them wearily, not bothering with the details.</p> <p>"Damn, Halloway," the jock says, looking around his apartment. "How about doing it without trashing the place?"</p> <p>I suppose a show of gratitude was too much to expect. "I got the job done, all right? That's more than you were able to do." I lift the garbage bag. "Wanna burn it?"</p> <p>Sondheim takes a step back, eyeing the sack like it ate his grandmother....</p></p><h2>The Wicca Spellbook: A Witch&#39;s Collection of Wiccan Spells, Potions, and Recipes</h2><p>Contains a collection of spells, potions, and recipes of the Wiccan community as well as an up-to-date directory of occult shops, publications, and services</p><p><b>Gerina Dunwich</b>&nbsp;was born on December 27, 1959. After discovering at a very young age that she possessed certain psychic gifts and the ability to make contact with spirits of the dead, she developed an intense interest in the world of the occult. In the summer of 1969 she was formally introduced to witchcraft and spiritualism by an older family member, and has since devoted her personal life and writing career to educating the public about the ways of the Craft.<br>As a teenager, Gerina Dunwich (using a different nom de plume at the time) began writing poetry, short stories, magazine articles, and stage plays complete with musical scores. Her first published newspaper article,&nbsp;<i>His Voice was His Vehicle,</i>&nbsp;was an interview with singer/songwriter Jim Peterik from the rock n&#x2019; roll group, the Ides of March (and later, Survivor). Co-written with her cousin, Barbara Williams, it was published in October 1976.<br>By the spring of 1980 Gerina Dunwich was publishing a small press literary journal called&nbsp;<i>Golden Isis,</i>&nbsp;a one-woman operation that specialized in Goddess-inspired poetry and offbeat fiction. Its international circulation grew to nearly 3600 and it attracted subscribers from places as far away as Puerto Rico, Australia, Italy, and Japan.&nbsp;<i>Circle of Shadows</i>&nbsp;- a collection of Gerina&#x2019;s own poetry, was self-published a decade later.<br>After visiting Salem, Massachusetts, in April of 1984, Gerina relocated to the North Shore of Boston, residing first in Beverly, and then in Ipswich. In the winter of 1986, she purchased the historic Moses Day Homestead - a stately 17th century Colonial house in Haverhill that had been built around the time of the infamous Salem witchcraft trials. The house, which had been featured in a local television documentary about haunted houses in the Boston area, was a hotbed of paranormal activity. Soon after moving there, Gerina experienced a vivid dream in which the spirit of the late witchcraft author Sybil Leek appeared and whispered to her that her destiny as an author was "written in the stars." The dream proved to be prophetic when, in 1987, Gerina landed her first book contract with Citadel Press. (Appropriately, the contract was dated October 31st.) The following year saw the publication of her first book,&nbsp;<i>Candlelight Spells,</i>&nbsp;and the start of her successful career as a prolific book author.<br>In December of 1993 she moved into a century-old Victorian mansion located in the quaint and historic town of Fort Covington, New York. She soon opened a small shop on High Street called "The Country Witch" (later renamed "The Calico Cat Whatnot Shop"), which sold antiques, curios and various occult supplies. (Coincidentally, the antique shop run by Sybil Leek in the New Forest was also located on a High Street.) The business proved to be instrumental in bringing together many of the area's Pagans, including several who would later become Gerina's close friends and members of her coven.<br>In February of 1998 Gerina Dunwich received a ministerial license from the Universal Life Church. Ironically, the first handfasting she performed as a legally ordained minister was for the younger brother of the cousin who had introduced her to witchcraft nearly thirty years earlier.<br>Gerina has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows throughout the United States and Canada. She has lectured and presented workshops at festivals and gatherings across the country, including the CraftWise Pagan Gathering (Waterbury, Connecticut), the Real Witches' Ball (Columbus, Ohio), and Panpipes' Pagan Day Festival (West Hollywood, California).<br>She is a member of the International Ghost Hunters Society, the Author&#x2019;s Guild, and the Fellowship of Isis. Her biography is listed in a number of reference works, such as&nbsp;<i>Who's Who in the East; Who&#x2019;s Who of American Women, Personalities of America;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Crossroads: Who's Who of the Magickal Community</i>&nbsp;(published by The Witching Well Education and Research Center, 1988). She is also mentioned in Anne Carson's&nbsp;<i>Goddesses and Wise Women,</i>&nbsp;Raymond Buckland&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>The Witch Book,</i>&nbsp;and other works.<br>In addition to being an occult author and respected spokesperson for the Neo-Pagan community, Gerina Dunwich is a freelance paranormal researcher who specializes in ghost animals and animal-related hauntings. In 2005 she founded the Paranormal Animal Research Group, which investigates haunted places and researches animal sensitivity to paranormal anomalies.</p><h2>Sky Tree: Seeing Science Through Art</h2><p><p>A tree stands on a hill by a river. As the sky changes, so does the tree, its branches filling with clouds, stars, snow, birds, mists, and the golden spring sun. One tree can mean many things.</p><p>Thomas Locker's lyrical text records the changes in the tree's world just as simply as a child might observe them, and his magnificent paintings crystallize the natural phenomena that embellish the tree on each page. Questions at the bottom of each page lead to a unique discussion in the back of the book, where art and science are intertwined, and further depth is added to the wonder of <i>Sky Tree.</i></p></p><p>Thomas Locker is a renowned author and artist who has earned several distinctions for his children's books, including the Parent's Choice Award for Illustration, and the New York Times Best Illustrated Books of the Year. Candace Christiansen is a teacher of chemistry and mathematics at a school in Columbia County, NY. She is also the author of three children's books. They live in Stuyvesant, NY. <p></p>Ages 6^-8, older for the art. It's rare that a book so obviously meant to serve more than one purpose manages the task with such polish. This collaboration speaks with a graceful simplicity that not only firmly fixes the relationship between art and science, but also subtly draws children into the miracles of nature itself. Elegant yet unpretentious oils depict a solitary tree, standing at river's edge and wrapped round by an expansive sky, as it's altered by the cycle of the seasons and the rising and setting of the sun. The tranquil mood of the artwork carries over into the main text, boxed in a background of changing sky, which provides the necessary context for the paintings. Beneath the main text are questions challenging children to explore the feelings the artwork inspires. This is the weakest part of the book, seeming more intended for grown-up facilitators--art and science teachers, Picture Ladies--than children themselves, as is the case with a follow-up section, "Connecting Art and Science in <i>Sky Tree</i>." Still, this is unquestionably a fascinating, even glorious celebration of nature that will stir both children and adults to a finer appreciation of a wondrous, surprising world that's right within their grasp. <i>Stephanie Zvirin</i></p><h2>The Big Cat Nap (Mrs. Murphy Mystery, 20th Anniversary)</h2><p>To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the beloved Mrs. Murphy mystery series, Rita Mae Brown and her intrepid feline co-author Sneaky Pie Brown return with a charming claw biting tale starring Mary Minor &#34;Harry&#34; Haristeen. Of course prowling faithfully at Harry&#39;s side are the sleuthing cats Mrs. Murphy, ever wise, and Pewter, reliably cranky and always primed with a razor sharp quip. Fiercely loyal and on the alert, corgi Tee Tucker is also never far behind. This time, Harry and her menagerie throw a wrench into the gears of a killer of grease monkeys.</p><p><b>Rita Mae Brown</b> is the bestselling author of several novels, including the Sneaky Pie Brown series; the Sister Jane series; the first two books in her new canine mystery series: <i>A Nose for Justice</i> and <i>Murder Unleashed; Rubyfruit Jungle; In Her Day; </i>and <i>Six of One. </i>An Emmy-nominated screenwriter and a poet, Brown lives in Afton, Virginia.<br><br><b>Sneaky Pie Brown,</b> a tiger cat born somewhere in Albemarle County, Virginia, was discovered by Rita Mae Brown at her local SPCA.

She landed in an old cherry tree covered in pink blossoms, which fluttered to the ground from the hawk&#x2019;s light impact. <br><br>&#x201c;Will you look at that?&#x201d; Miranda Hogendobber exclaimed from behind the Outback&#x2019;s wheel, as she drove to the garden center over in Waynesboro. <br><br>&#x201c;Raptors fascinate me, but they scare me, too,&#x201d; Harry Haristeen remarked. &#x201c;Poor little mouse.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;There is that.&#x201d; Miranda slowed for a sharp curve. <br><br>Central Virginia, celebrating high spring, was also digging out from torrential rains over the weekend. <br><br>Harry, forty and fit, and Miranda, late sixties and not advertising, had worked together for years at the old Crozet post office. <br><br>When Miranda&#x2019;s husband, George, died, Harry, fresh from Smith College, took his position as head of the P.O., never thinking the job would last nearly two decades. Miranda, despite her loss, showed up every day to help orient the young woman whom she&#x2019;d known as a baby. Harry&#x2019;s youth raised Miranda&#x2019;s spirits. In mourning, it&#x2019;s especially good to have a task. Over the years they became extremely close, almost a mother&#x2013;daughter bond. Harry&#x2019;s mother had died when Harry was in her early twenties. <br><br>Noticing fields filled with the debris of the now-subsiding waters, Harry observed, &#x201c;What a mess. Can&#x2019;t turn out stock in that. You just don&#x2019;t know what else is wrapped up in all those branches and twigs.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Hey, there&#x2019;s a plastic chair. Might look good in your yard.&#x201d; Miranda smiled. <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Harry drawled the word out, like the native Southerner she was. <br><br>The younger woman, generous with her time and happy to feed anyone, could be tight with the buck. Miranda couldn&#x2019;t resist teasing Harry about a free if ugly chair. <br><br>&#x201c;This is sure better than my 1961 Falcon,&#x201d; the older woman said. &#x201c;Initially I resisted the Outback&#x2019;s fancy radio. I mean, this is a used car and had the Sirius capabilities, but I didn&#x2019;t want to pay extra. How did I live without it?&#x201d; Miranda mused, now a Subaru convert. <br><br>&#x201c;Regular cars can now do more than Mercedes or even Rolls from ten years ago. That&#x2019;s what amazes me: the speed with which the technological developments of those high-end cars became commonplace in much-lower-priced vehicles. But I still love my old 1978 F-150 and you still drive your old Falcon. Hey, want me to wax it?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Would you? What a lovely offer.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You know how crazy I get with anything with an engine in it. I&#x2019;ll clean the tires, refresh your dash. I&#x2019;m a one-woman detailing operation.&#x201d; <br><br>Her eyebrows knitting together, Miranda said, &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d; <br><br>An odd pop, then a lurch, made holding the Outback on theroad difficult. <br><br>&#x201c;Put on your flashers and brake.&#x201d; <br><br>They slid toward a narrow drainage ditch, and the airbags billowed up inside as the wheel dipped in the ditch. Miranda couldn&#x2019;t see. <br><br>If there was enough room, narrow drainage ditches, about one to two feet deep, paralleled the country roads. Occasionally, small culverts passed the runoff under farm driveways or sharp curves, moving the water, which could rise very quickly, away from the roads. <br><br>Even without vision, Miranda was not one to panic. She braked smoothly, and the right side of the car dropped into the ditch. The car rocked a little. <br><br>Asleep on the backseat, Harry&#x2019;s two cats and dog rolled off. <br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Pewter, the rotund gray cat, howled. <br><br>The tiger cat, Mrs. Murphy, and the corgi, Tee Tucker, scrambled back up on the seat. <br><br>&#x201c;No other cars,&#x201d; the dog noted. <br><br>The tiger cat looked around. &#x201c;Right.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I was asleep.&#x201d; Pewter hauled herself up to sit next to her friends. <br><br>&#x201c;We all were,&#x201d; Mrs. Murphy drily noted. <br><br>&#x201c;Well&#x2014;I was more asleep.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry, already outside, having punctured the air bag with the penknife she always carried in her hip pocket, crouched down to look at the undercarriage. Then she walked to the right front side of the car, front end inthe ditch. <br><br>&#x201c;See anything?&#x201d; As best she could, Miranda rolled up her air bag, which Harry had also punctured. <br><br>Harry called back, &#x201c;Your right tire is cracked; the rubber&#x2019;s flat, too. Do you have Triple A?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I do.&#x201d; Miranda slid out as Harry helped her. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m going to call Safe and Sound instead.&#x201d; <br><br>Safe &amp; Sound, founded and run by Alphonse &#x201c;Latigo&#x201d; Bly, was headquartered in Charlottesville. Specializing in auto insurance, the company covered the mid-Atlantic and coastal South. Many business people believed Safe &amp; Sound would go national, sooner or later. <br><br>As Miranda called, Harry opened the back door of the Outback. <br><br>&#x201c;Does anyone need to go potsie?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Must she put it that way?&#x201d; Pewter grumbled. &#x201c;And I am not about to get my paws wet.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re okay.&#x201d; The corgi answered for the rest of the animals. Not seeing one of her best friends budge, Harry closed the door to the rear, then did her best to fold her air bag back into the dash. <br><br>Miranda was already on the phone with Safe &amp; Sound, spilling out details, perhaps too many. <br><br>With difficulty, Harry opened the glove compartment, pulling out the manual. <br><br>Having concluded her phone conversation, Miranda informed Harry, &#x201c;Someone will be here in twenty minutes. Says don&#x2019;t call Triple A. He takes care of this stuff all the time.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Always best to do business with friends,&#x201d; Harry observed. &#x201c;When you try to save money, you usually waste time or spend even more money. Safe and Sound is local.&#x201d; <br><br>Miranda sighed. &#x201c;The older I get, the more I realize time is more precious than money.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry, flipping through the manual, stopped at a schematic drawing of the auto frame. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not old. Anyone who sings in the choir, gardens like you do, and is a member of every &#x2018;do-good&#x2019; group in the state of Virginia isn&#x2019;t old.&#x201d; Changing the subject&#x2014;a habit with dear friends&#x2014;Harry declared, &#x201c;Whatever happened, it wasn&#x2019;t the engine. It may be a defective wheel, but there was that odd pop sound.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I couldn&#x2019;t steer after that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Weird.&#x201d; Harry glanced back at the manual. &#x201c;Subaru makes great cars for the money.&#x201d; A fresh breeze brought the aroma of blossoms, flowers, and hay coming up, filling her nostrils. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be curious to find out what happened. How lucky we were that the car swerved to the right, not the left into oncoming traffic. Better yet, there wasn&#x2019;t any traffic.&#x201d; Miranda exhaled. <br><br>&#x201c;Monday afternoon. Everyone&#x2019;s at work or in the fields. Herb&#x2019;s truck is in the shop, too, after his collision last week,&#x201d; Harry said, thinking of the minister at St. Luke&#x2019;s Lutheran Church, the Very Reverend Herbert Jones. &#x201c;Things go in threes. Maybe I&#x2019;m next.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what happened, but I bet that will cost Herb an arm and a leg. Truck&#x2019;s still at ReNu,&#x201d; Miranda said, naming the garage favored by the insurance company. &#x201c;He was driving his Chevy truck. His &#x2018;bigfib&#x2019; truck.&#x201d; <br><br>They laughed, because the Chevy, used for fishing and filled with tackle, was also filled with fish stories. Oh, how Herb could wax poetic on the one that got away! He was also all too happy to show what he had actually snagged, though the cats generally proved more interested in the display than did the humans. <br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to be stuck on the side of the road, best it happens on a beautiful spring day.&#x201d; Harry smiled. &#x201c;We were lucky. Unlike Tara Meola.&#x201d; <br><br>Harry shuddered at the thought of the poor young woman killed last week in the hard rains when a deer smashed into her vehicle. <br><br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Miranda nodded. <br><br>&#x201c;You just never know,&#x201d; Harry sighed.<br>2 <br><br>After a bitterly cold winter, spring had stayed cool until late April. It was now late May. Nights in the mid-forties or mid-fifties promised days in the sixties. Late-blooming dogwoods dotted the forests and manicured lawns. Over pergolas, the wisteria hung pendulous with lavender or white blossoms. The roses threatened to riot. <br><br>Harry walked through her tended acres. The farm maintained a healthy balance of crops, hay, and woodlands. Mrs. Murphy, Tucker, and Pewter followed, taking numerous side trips to investigate rabbit warrens and fox dens. The butterflies danced together, swirling, fluttering their beautiful veined wings. <br><br>Eying them deviously, Pewter crouched down. <br><br>&#x201c;They see you,&#x201d; Tucker said. <br><br>Ignoring the ever-practical dog, Pewter wiggled her gray butt, then leapt upward. <br><br>Without breaking rhythm, the butterflies flew away. <br><br>&#x201c;Almost had &#x2019;em.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Dream on,&#x201d; the corgi teased. <br><br>Mrs. Murphy at her heels, Harry turned. &#x201c;Come on, you two.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s always giving orders,&#x201d; Pewter grumbled. <br><br>&#x201c;True,&#x201d; the handsome dog agreed. &#x201c;And she also always feeds us on time.&#x201d; <br><br>Considering this, the fat cat trotted toward Harry, who was now leaning over to inspect the tops of sunflower plants just breaking the surface. <br><br>&#x201c;With a little luck, I&#x2019;m going to have a good year.&#x201d;Harry smiled, then moved on to her quarter acre of Petit Manseng grapes. <br><br>Dr. Thomas Walker, Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s gu...</p><h2>Trigun Maximum Volume 14: Mind Games</h2><p>Fourteen volumes, almost three-thousand pages, an internationally popular anime, and one of the most recognizable characters in the genre: this is the saga of Vash the Stampede.

But the newest contender in this savage arena, as demonic to behold as he is deadly to challenge, is fighting for more than just survival. His do-or-die mission, for the dark masters he serves, is to capture the ultimate weapon: an object that will enable the Sith to conquer the galaxy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sith lords Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious are determined to possess the prize. And one of the power-hungry duo has his own treacherous plans for it. But first, their fearsome apprentice must take on a bloodthirsty prison warden, a cannibal gang, cutthroat crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and an unspeakable alien horror. No one else could brave such a gauntlet of death and live. But no one else is the dreaded dark-side disciple known as Darth Maul.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Lockdown</i></b> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Schreiber . . . was a great choice for this novel, imbuing the story with a dark, foreboding tone while never quite stepping into the horror territories that <i>Death Troopers</i> and <i>Red Harvest</i> took us.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Jedi News</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Fans of the dark side should rejoice. <i>Lockdown</i> delivers a can&#x2019;t-put-this-down tale of scum and villainy.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Club Jade</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[<i>Lockdown </i>is] an action-packed ride that spins one entertaining chapter after another. The multiple layers of story keeps readers guessing what will happen next and just who will live and who will die. . . . It certainly adds to the character of Darth Maul while matching [<i>Darth</i>] <i>Plagueis</i>&#x2019;s complexity with sheer fun. . . . Five out of five metal bikinis.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Roqoo Depot</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Somehow, Schreiber is able to skate the line between hard-hitting prison story and the adventure and excitement I love from <i>Star Wars</i> in a way that doesn&#x2019;t betray either genre. It&#x2019;s really quite masterful.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Big Shiny Robot</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;<i>Lockdown</i> is an exciting, engaging read. . . . It actually lines up beautifully for a sequel, which I, for one, would love to read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Coffee with Kenobi</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;The novel makes <i>The Clone Wars</i> better.

This book was so fun and entertaining. I&#x2019;ll have to keep an eye out for more <i>Star Wars</i> books from Schreiber.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Seattle Geekly</i></b></p><p><b>Joe Schreiber</b> is the author of several novels, including <i>Star Wars: Red Harvest, Star Wars: Death Troopers, Chasing the Dead, </i>and<i> Au Revoir, Crazy European Chick</i>. He was born in Michigan but spent his formative years in Alaska, Wyoming, and Northern California. He lives in central Pennsylvania with his wife and two children.1<br><br>Cog Hive Seven<br><br>Wham!<br><br>The first punch came at Maul sideways, spinning his upper body around with the sheer force of the impact and driving him back a half step before he fully recovered his equilibrium. Somewhere under his feet, the alloy plates of the cell&#x2019;s floor seemed to shiver and quake, threatening to give way.<br><br>He spat out a tooth and wiped away the blood.<br><br>The creature in front of him was a walking trophy case of previous kills. Two and a half meters high, its massive shoulders and upper torso encased in jagged plates of primitive armor that clearly had once served as the jawbone and carapace of a much larger predator, it seemed to occupy an entire corner of the prison cell.<br><br>Maul stared at the thing. The gray slope of its face was a surgeon&#x2019;s nightmare of ritualistic scars, metal rings and studs, wire loops, and hooks, with bluish sacks pulsating beneath its eyes, all of it siphoning down and inward toward a gaping, razor-toothed mouth. Even its arms seemed to have been plucked from two different organisms. The right hand was a blunt-knuckled fist, the left an elongated spider-fingered claw. Together they formed a mallet and blade, one made for pounding, the other for slashing. It was the right that had come careening out of nowhere just seconds before, slamming Maul backward and knocking out one of his teeth.<br><br>The thing reached down and picked up Maul&#x2019;s incisor from the floor of the cell. Straightening up, it shoved the tooth into an empty space in its own mouth, twisting it until it lodged in place. Then it grinned at Maul as if asking how he liked the sight of one of his teeth in its mouth&#x2014;another trophy for its collection.<br><br>Maul gazed back at it.<br><br>And then the rage came.<br><br>And the rage was good.<br><br>The uniform they&#x2019;d given him was a standard orange jumpsuit whose heavy fabric cut off movement in most directions. Maul heard its seams ripping as he sprang at his opponent, closing the half-meter gap between them in less than a second. The thing responded exactly as he&#x2019;d hoped, lunging up eagerly to meet his advance. Its mismatched arms pinwheeled wildly before it, swinging and clawing through the stale gray air of the cell, its voice screeching at him in a guttural, choking language he&#x2019;d never heard before.<br><br>Let those be your dying words, Maul thought. Right here. Today.<br><br>Close enough now that he could smell the corpse-stink pouring off it like rotten meat, he fell into a reflexive series of moves. Both hands shot out and grabbed the creature by its throat, hoisting it up over his head and squeezing until he felt the deep tendons of its neck beginning to give and weaken in his grip. There was a wet, muffled click from somewhere inside the thing&#x2019;s chest and a sudden glut of warm, thick, sticky fluid began spurting up from its throat.<br><br>Blood.<br><br>Jet black.<br><br>The sight of it gave Maul no satisfaction, only the vaguely annoying realization that it never should have taken him this long to turn the battle to his advantage. Still, ending his opponent&#x2019;s life quickly would restore a certain necessary balance to the encounter&#x2014;if not honor, at least vindication. He tightened his grip, and the screaming sound got louder, becoming a broken, birdlike squawk. More blood leapt up, inky black and viscous, and started pouring from its mouth and eye sockets.<br><br>Enough.<br><br>Executing a perfectly balanced spin, Maul swung the creature around and slammed it to the floor with a sharp clang, connecting hard enough that he felt the steel plates reverberate under his feet. The thing&#x2019;s head drooped on its broken neck, lolling sideways to expose the throbbing vessels beneath its gray flesh.<br><br>Only now did Maul allow himself to exhale. As anticipated, he hadn&#x2019;t needed his lightsaber staff or the Force to dispatch this waste of flesh&#x2014;not that either was really an option. Staring down into the thing&#x2019;s face, he raised his foot and planted his heel in the exposed throat, ready to pulverize the trachea, or whatever the thing used for an airway, with one decisive stomp. For an instant he met its sagging, inarticulate eyes.<br><br>Now, he instructed the thing, which seemed to be realizing that it was destined to finish out the final pathetic seconds of its life here in nameless obscurity. Die.<br><br>All at once, with blinding speed, the creature yanked loose and burst upright, reaching behind its back to produce what appeared to be a long bow staff. As the staff blurred toward him, Maul realized that the weapon, which he&#x2019;d first taken to be a piece of wood or some kind of biomechanical hybrid, was actually a living organism&#x2014;a serpent whose head lashed out at lightning velocity, latching onto his face, slashing at his eyes.<br><br>Maul recoiled, but it was too late. With a jolt, his vision was gone, burying him in instant darkness. This was the second time in as many seconds that the thing had caught him off guard, and now he knew why: the creature was somehow cut off from the Force, utterly detached from the deep field of heightened sensitivity from which he was constantly drawing information about his surroundings. The intuitive sensory abilities that he took for granted in any normal battle were simply not there.<br><br>An acidic heaviness took hold of his optic nerves like a slow drip, seeping in, sinking deep, and he realized that he could already feel the poison taking control, spreading out in concentric layers of numbness through the muscle and tissue of his face.<br><br>Now the thing&#x2019;s shrieking laughter was everywhere. Willful. Triumphant.<br><br>You must end this now.<br><br>Maul straightened. The voice in his head was his own, an austere evocation of his own training. But the cadence was unmistakably his Master&#x2019;s&#x2014;an echo of pitiless instruction, hours, days, years of unyielding pain and discipline. Sidious was never far from him. The evocation of the Sith Lord&#x2019;s presence here snapped him back instantly into the moment with total clarity.<br><br>Reaching up through blindness, Maul took hold of the serpent, grappling with its fully extended length. Somewhere in the void he could feel the rippling leathery sinew of the staff looping around his neck, felt the hundreds of small muscles twisting and constricting over his windpipe, pinching off his airway like a living noose. The next few seconds would be crucial.<br><br>He flexed, bent his head, and jerked it forward, but the thing would not release. It kept encircling him, looping round and round, defying every attempt to take hold of it.<br><br>Maul willed himself to be absolutely still, a study in perfect rigidity, allowing the serpent, in its moment of fatal overconfidence, to draw tighter still, stretching itself until he sensed its head coming back around in front of him once more. Still he waited. Above it all he could smell his opponent&#x2019;s fetid stench, could feel the claws of his opponent raking his skin, twisting into his face, gouging for purchase. It shrieked at him, and this time the cry was pure victory, what might even have been laughter. Starved, insane. A warrior with nothing to lose.<br><br>You are no warrior, Maul thought. You know nothing of the dark side.<br><br>The moment had come. He grasped the head of the amphistaff, seizing its blunt nose and fanged mouth. His fingers took hold of its distended upper part, twisting, wrenching, until he tore the serpent&#x2019;s head off its body with a moist and meaty pop.<br><br>The results were instantaneous. With a twitching galvanic shudder, the snake loosened and fell slack, the coils already beginning to slide from his neck, and Maul allowed himself a single, unobstructed breath before finishing his work here.<br><br>Somewhere in front of him, the attacker had already responded to the death of his weapon with a howl of cheated rage. Maul no longer heard it. Primal as it was, it was still only emotion, a cry of weakness no more instructive or relevant than the pain he&#x2019;d willed away moments earlier. He had no more use for it now than he ever did.<br><br>He did, however, take advantage of his opponent&#x2019;s scream just long enough to reach into its open mouth, feeling the moist warmth of its breath on his hand as he retrieved his tooth, plucking it from the thing&#x2019;s gums. Holding the mouth agape, Maul crammed the serpent&#x2019;s severed head inside, then clamped the gray lips tight to keep the snake&#x2019;s head from falling out. He ripped three of the larger piercings from the thing&#x2019;s right arm and jammed them upward through the lips, bending them back into barbed hooks and fastening the mouth shut with the serpent&#x2019;s head still trapped inside. With his hands flattened against those lips, Maul could feel the head twitching around inside the mouth, sinking its fangs in reflexively, squirting out venom while his attacker jerked and spasmed and tried in vain to scream.<br><br>End it.<br><br>Still sightless, now holding his opponent at arm&#x2019;s length, Maul inclined his own head down. He thrust forward, driving his horns into the thing&#x2019;s sagging eyes, feeling them crushed to jelly against his scalp.<br><br>The spasms stopped, and Maul stepped back, releasing the body, allowing it to collapse at his feet.<br><br>He blinked and narrowed his own still-burning eyes, clutching his tooth in his hand. His vision was already starting to come back in murky shades of gunmetal gray and metallic blue. The process was infuriatingly slow, but it was happening. There was no reason not to assume that within a few hours, he would be fully recovered, and when&#x2014;<br><br>The floor began to shake.<br><br>Maul whipped around, scanning the depths of his cell for the vibration&#x2019;s source. From all around him, a ratcheting cacophony had taken hold of the cell, the sound of massive chains being dragged through the sprockets and pulleys of some vast piece of clockwork. It filled the entire chamber, rising to a deafening roar. Everything around him had begun to shift and tilt. Maul reached out, fingertips confirming what he&#x2019;d already begun to suspect.<br><br>The walls were closing in.<br><br>This was no illusion, no side effect of crippled vision. The cell itself was literally changing shape&#x2014;the individual steel plates that formed the walls and floors and ceiling all overlapping and sliding together like great mechanical scales, curving inward as the slant of its floor became steeper, transforming into a kind of bowl, opening in the middle to create a funnel.<br><br>Reaching backward, Maul grabbed the handhold bolted into the bench behind him, clutching it for balance and holding on tight. All around him, the grating howl and shriek of metal got louder as a hole opened in the middle of the floor.<br><br>He furrowed his brow, squinting down into it. His vision had become clear enough now that he could make out the lifeless corpse of his former attacker, the thing in its broken and now utterly useless organic armor sliding downward toward the center of the cell. It sagged forward on a streaking smear of its own black blood, a slave to simple physics, its passage into oblivion followed in short order by the limp, decapitated body of the snake-staff.<br><br>Maul watched as warrior and staff both slipped through the hole and out of sight into a bath of darkness almost as deep as the one from which he himself had just emerged. For an instant&#x2014;was it real?&#x2014;he thought he saw something pale and eyeless reaching up to suck the bodies down.<br><br>The hole closed again and the floor shifted itself, smoothing out and becoming flat once more. The clanking and shaking stopped. The cell around him had resumed its previous rectilinear shape.<br><br>Somewhere in front of him, a panel of red lights blinked and went green.<br><br>He waited as the cell began to carry him upward.</p><h2>The Last Thirteen: 13 (Book 1)</h2><p>Very good condition no highlighting.</p><p></p><h2>Letters to a Young Artist</h2><p>This pocket-sized book contains a collection of two dozen letters all commissioned from established artists to a fictitious "young artist," a recent art-school graduate who is struggling with the moral and practical implications of being an artist in New York. The "young artist" asked a selection of his heroes, "Is it possible to maintain one's integrity and freedom of thought and still participate in the art world?" Responding artists--including Gregory Amenoff, Jo Baer, John Baldessari, Jimmie Durham, Joan Jonas, Adrian Piper, William Pope Lawrence Weiner and Richard Tuttle wrote back with advice (Gregory Amenoff: "Keep away from art fairs."); encouragement (Joan Jonas: "The answer is the Work. To Work. To care about the Work."); and cautionary tales (Adrian Piper: "Young artist, it is highly unlikely that you will be rewarded professionally for reaching this point. Nor will it make you popular. On the contrary: you will develop a reputation for being 'difficult,' 'uncooperative,' 'inflexible,' or even 'self-destructive;' and treated [or mistreated, or ostracized, or blacklisted] accordingly."). Twelve of these letters were originally published in <i>Art on Paper</i>.

Each one's ability to reach out in familiar ways certainly diminishes yet he or she is always able to experience the deep benefits that come from being in vital relationship with others. Inside Alzheimer's tells how dozens of persons with dementia and their sharing of wisdom, humor and life's teachings led Ms. Pearce to the six basic principles of connection--how one person connects with another: Intend a connection, Free yourself of judgment, Love, Open to receive love, Silence and Thankfulness. Internalizing these principles has empowered hundreds of family, friends, and professionals to create moments of connection with persons, regardless of how advanced the dementia, and to co-create a more supportive community of care.<br>Inside Alzheimers was revised to address the dramatic need to simultaneously provide a compassionate community of care for the one person who does not have any time or energy left to even pick up a book the frequently isolated and overwhelmed 24/7 caregiver.

In her practice, she integrates her education research foundations with understanding from both her work experience and studies in spiritual and religious wisdom traditions. Ms. Pearce specializes in working with persons who have dementia and teaches families, friends and professionals, both nationally and internationally, how to communicate and connect effectively with persons who have dementia.One of Library Journal s Best Consumer Health Books of the Year. One of the most devastating consequences of Alzheimer's diseases for patients and their caretakers is the inevitable loss of the ability to communicate and form connections. In her first book, Pearce--a medical social worker with more than 20 years of experience working in long-term healthcare and hospice settings--reminds readers that there is a person inside Alzheimer's and other dementias who needs to be heard, seen, valued, and appreciated. Writing for family members, friends, healthcare professionals, and those who want to form and maintain meaningful connections with dementia patients, Pearce teaches her six principles of connection: intend a connection, free yourself of judgment, love, be open to being loved, silence, and thankfulness. Each chapter includes stories and anecdotes about people with Alzheimer's and ends with a summary and exercises for "working it out." Including resources and filled with practical wisdom, this groundbreaking, transformational, and informative book is highly recommended for all public and academic libraries --Elizabeth M.

It can be a warning or force us to rest our bodies. Yet most ongoing chronic pain, such as unrelenting backache or headache, has no discernable cause and diminishes countless lives. Over the years a scientific revolution has taken place in chronic pain research and therapy. A major catalyst for this was the introduction of the "gate theory" by Professor Ronald Melzack and Professor Patrick D. Wall, which argued that pain is a unified stream of experience generated by the brain, incorporating a whole host of psychological functions. Their now-classic book, with a new introduction taking in all the latest medical developments, examines every facet of pain: the psychological and clinical aspects, the physiological evidence, the major theories of pain, and the developments in its control. The challenge in the 21st century is to look at how memories, personal and social expectations, genetics, gender, aging, and stress patterns all play a role in pain, and how understanding this could lead to the relief of the suffering endured by millions.</p><p><p><b>Ronald Melzack</b> is Professor Emeritus of psychology at McGill University.

Missing for more than four decades has been a third perspective on the events that brought their marriage to its ill-fated end, the story of another&#x2014;the other&#x2014;woman: Hughes&#x2019; mistress Assia Wevill.<br><br>Like Plath before her, Assia shared her life with Hughes for seven years, until she took her own life and that of their daughter at the age of forty-two, in a manner that nearly replicated Plath&#x2019;s suicide six years earlier. Drawing on previously unavailable documents and private papers, including Assia&#x2019;s diaries and her intimate correspondence with Hughes, this book shows the vital influence Assia exerted on the poet and his work, and the uneasy life they shared under the long shadow of Plath.<br><br><i>A Lover of Unreason</i> is the first-ever full-length biography of Assia Wevill. It casts a keen light, and explores the emergence of a singular twentieth-century woman. Three-times divorc�e, career woman, mistress, and single mother, Assia Wevill openly defied the conventions of a censorious pre-feminist Britain and mesmerized men and women alike with her quick-mind and exotic beauty.<br></p><p>Eilat Negevi is the senior literary correspondent for <i>Yedioth Achronot</i> , the major Israeli daily newspaper.

Three years later, in October 2005, before a similarly discerning audience, they delivered the closing lecture of the Hughes International Conference at Emory University.<br>The "other woman" in the Sylvia Plath&#x2013;Ted Hughes divorce receives long-delayed consideration in this assiduously researched, compulsively readable biography, where the authors draw on newly revealed primary sources. The life of thrice-married Assia Wevill (1927&#x2013;1969) makes a fascinating story even before her six-year affair with Hughes and the birth of his (unacknowledged) daughter, Shura. Born in Berlin of a Russian Jewish father and a German Lutheran mother, raised in Tel Aviv, married to a British soldier in order to gain a British passport, Assia was, as the authors demonstrate, a smoldering femme fatale, albeit highly intelligent, witty and talented. While Koren and Negev (<i>In Our Hearts We Were Giants: The Remarkable Story of the Lilliput Troupe</i>) don't whitewash Assia's volatile, self-absorbed personality or her serial adulteries, they do contradict the widespread impression that Assia was the initial seducer of Hughes. This will be an important book for Hughes scholars, primarily for the authors' exclusive 1996 interview with the poet, in which he identified the poems he wrote alluding to Assia after her death, which he felt no critic had ever interpreted correctly. Newly revealed letters and interviews reinforce previous accounts of Hughes's sexual attraction and the dedicated philandering that drove two women to suicide.

The galaxy remembers him as a hero: the man who burned every last alien Cielcin from the sky. They remember him as a monster: the devil who destroyed a sun, casually annihilating four billion human lives--even the Emperor himself--against Imperial orders.But Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier.Fleeing his father and a future as a torturer, Hadrian finds himself stranded on a strange, backwater world.

Salvatore has spent so many years winding himself into fantasy worlds that he's still tyring to figure out how to unwind. He is the author of more than forty novels and more than a dozen <i>New York Times</i> best sellers, including <i>The Two Swords</i>, which debuted at or near the top of many best seller lists.Elf ranger Drizzt Do'Urden and his gifted warriors go in search of a missing member of their own band in this latest fast-moving fantasy adventure from bestseller Salvatore (Servant of the Shard, etc.). In the previous episode of the Paths of Darkness series (of the Forgotten Realms umbrella series), Wulfgar the barbarian fought a demon, was possessed and supposedly killed. Now it turns out that not only is he alive but he is in need of the type of assistance at which his friends excel. Getting to Wulfgar and aiding him in his quest for Aegis-fang, his warhammer, is only part of the fun. Drizzt Do'Urden, along with Cattie-Brie, a dwarf named Bruenor Battlehammer and Regis the Halfling, often have to battle the obligatory orcs, goblins and ogres on their way to the real business at hand. A second plot involves the stalking of Drizzt Do'Urden by Le'Lorinel, a Moon elf (or pale elf, whereas Drizzt is a Drow or dark elf). The author combines some of the good versus evil of Robin Hood and his merry men, the campy heroics and friendship of The Princess Bride (including an appearance of dread pirate Sheila Kree) and a rather unfulfilled stab at race relations with Le'Lorinel's unhinged hatred for Drizzt Do'Urden. As this is the fourth novel in the subseries of a larger series, it is not for the uninitiated. Long-awaited by Salvatore's legions of fans, however, this book is as certain as its predecessors to climb bestseller charts. 10-city author tour. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The One Year Bible - Catholic: NLT</h2><p>Over 4 million readers have benefited from reading <i>The One Year Bible.</i> Now, Catholic readers will have the full Catholic New Living Translation available in <i>The One Year Bible</i> format.

I won't put up with this any longer. Tomorrow you'll sit in the marketplace and be a diviner!"&nbsp;"Jamell, are you insane?" said Ahmed. "What do I know about fortunetelling?"&nbsp;"You don't need to know a thing," said Jamell. "When anyone brings you a question, you just throw the dice and mumble something that sounds wise. It's either that, or I go home to the house of my father!"&nbsp;So the next day, Ahmed sold his shovel and his pick and bought the dice and the board and the robe of a fortuneteller. Then he sat in the marketplace near the public bath.&nbsp;Hardly had he gotten settled when there ran up to him the wife of one of the King's ministers.&nbsp;"Diviner, you must help me! I wore my most precious ring to the bath today, and now it's missing. Please, tell me where it is!"&nbsp;Ahmed gulped and cast the dice. As he desperately searched for something wise to say, he happened to glance up at the lady's cloak. There he spied a small hole, and showing through the hole, a bit of her naked arm.&nbsp;Of course, this was quite improper for a respectable lady, so Ahmed leaned forward and whispered urgently, "Madam, I see a hole."&nbsp;"A what?" asked the lady, leaning closer.&nbsp;"A hole! A hole!"&nbsp;The lady brightened. "Of course! A hole!"&nbsp;She rushed back to the bath and found the hole in the wall where she had hidden her ring for safekeeping. Then she came back out to Ahmed.&nbsp;"God be praised!" she said. "You knew right where it was!" And to Ahmed's amazement, she gave him a gold coin.&nbsp;That evening, when Jamell saw the coin and heard the story, she said, "You see? There's nothing to it!"&nbsp;"God was merciful on this day," said Ahmed, "but I dare not test Him on another!"&nbsp;"Nonsense," said Jamell. "If you want to keep your wife, you'll be back in the marketplace tomorrow."&nbsp;See above.</p><h2>Warrior: The Amazing Story of a Real War Horse</h2><p>December 2011 sees the premier of Steven Spielberg&#39;s much anticipated film, &#34;War Horse&#34;, which is the most popular piece of fiction ever written about horses in war. &#34;My Horse Warrior&#34;, first published in 1934 is equally wondrous fact.

The book tells the whole history of Warrior from his birth in an Isle of Wight field, to his amazing life as a famous war horse and how a combination of both the horse&#39;s extraordinary character and some unbelievable twists of fate, helped him survive a war which claimed the lives of 8 million horses.

Here, behind a tall stuccoed wall, Mick Aarestrup greets us at the private escape he and his wife designer Paula Batali have created at their 1930s hideaway house. The Mediterranean-style building appears at first to be all white-painted glamour with deep aquamarine blue trim. Mick throws open the doors to let us in and we are embraced by rooms where painted antiques of simple lines, natural materials and fine art all combine into a soothing space of deep personal expression. </p> <p>Similar to their home, Mick and Paula seem to be the perfect exciting fusion of South American sophistication meeting Nordic soul. The couple&#x2019;s shared passion and ease with art and design reveals itself in their confident mix of decor. Elements, as disparate as a 1720s leather upholstered chair and an Anne Foresman painting, when put together in the intimate, domestic scale of the bungalow are totally energized. &#x201c;It is best,&#x201d; says Mick, &#x201c;to have a mixture of pieces, not all the same period. Just like we&#x2019;re all different from one another so are the homes we embody and the objects we fill them with. Everybody demands a certain amount of space, and plays very well with some and not so well with others. By mixing periods then, every piece gets their own voice.&#x201d; Both Swedish and South American designers seem to have mastered the power of mingling past and present as a very powerful means to evoke not just great beauty but also associations and sentiment.</p> <p>Paula concurs that there is more similarity between Brazilian and Swedish design than one would initially suspect. &#x201c;I am from Rio de Janeiro and consider myself very fortunate to come from a place where creativity and the design process is spontaneous, na�ve and very much inspired by nature and materials. I believe that in this aspect, both countries have a similar approach to design. Brazilian furniture and interiors have a fluidity and an airy quality to them, and because of that, I was able to immediately relate to Swedish design.&#x201d; </p> <p>In terms of living with antiques in modern settings, this is something she is entirely used to from her upbringing. A happy memory for Paula is of her father collecting antiques. &#x201c;My family always seemed perplexed with my father&#x2019;s obsession&#x2015;collecting really old and odd-looking stuff! Brazil is a new country! The antiques I was exposed to were mainly Portuguese Baroque; it was everywhere around my parents&#x2019; apartment. </p></p><h2>Doom Patrol, Book 3: Down Paradise Way</h2><p>The Doom Patrol faces a merciless attack by the forces of normality, a team member&#39;s startling transformation, and a journey beyond space and time to join opposing sides of an ancient alien war.</p><p>Writer <b>Grant Morrison</b> is known for his innovative work on comics from the graphic novel <i>Arkham Asylum</i> to acclaimed runs on <i>Animal Man</i> and <i>Doom Patrol</i>, as well as his subversive creator-owned titles such as <i>The Invisibles, Seaguy,</i> and <i>WE3</i>. Grant has also written best-selling runs on <i>JLA</i>, <i>Seven Soldiers of Victory,</i> and <i>New X-Men,</i> and helped to reinvent the DC Universe in <i>The Multiversity, All Star Superman, 52, Batman, Batman &amp; Robin</i> and <i>Batman, Inc</i>.In the 1960s, the Doom Patrol was a -second-string superhero team whose freakish powers caused humanity to shun them (as it did their better-known contemporaries, Marvel's X-Men) and led to them being touted as "The World's Strangest Heroes." In the late 1980s, writer Morrison, recently noticed for drastically rejiggering another marginal sixties character, Animal Man, overhauled the Doom Patrol similarly, giving it a new cast far more deserving of the strangest-heroes mantle. Crazy Jane possesses 64 distinct personalities, each with its own superpower. Rebis is a bandaged hermaphrodite who encompasses a being made of negative energy. Ape-faced Dorothy Spinner can distort reality. The new villains were as outre. Here the DP faces the Men from N.O.W.H.E.R.E., dedicated to eliminating all eccentricities and anomalies. Another nemesis is Danny the Street, a sentient, transvestite street (no metaphor he) that moves about at will. During Morrison's run on <i>Doom Patrol</i>, plotlines generally took a backseat to outlandish concepts, and later issues bordered on incomprehensibility. This collection's contents, however, balance bizarreness and accessibility relatively well. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Dill has always been branded as an outsider due to his family heritage as snake handlers and poison drinkers, an essential part of their Pentecostal faith. But after his father is sent to prison for sexual abuse of a young parishioner, Dill and his mother become real pariahs. His only two friends are Travis, a gentle giant who works at his family's lumberyard and is obsessed with a Game of Thrones-like fantasy series (much to his alcoholic father's chagrin); and Lydia, who runs a popular fashion blog that's part Tavi Gevinson and part Angela Chase, and is actively plotting her escape from Redneckville, Tennessee.<br>As the three friends begin their senior year, it becomes clear that they won't all be getting to start a promising new life after graduation. How they deal with their diverging paths could cause the end of their friendship. Until a shattering act of random violence forces Dill to wrestle with his dark legacy and find a way into the light of a future worth living.</p><p><b>Jeff Zentner</b> is a singer-songwriter and guitarist who has recorded with Iggy Pop, Nick Cave and Debbie Harry.

Based on hundreds of interviews with unique sources - including four extensive personal interviews with Castro - Guerrilla Prince is an intimate and revealing portrait, charged with all the electricity of the charismatic man himself. In this edition, Geyer adds a preface and an extensive epilogue to her 1991 hardcover text, addressing the changes since that time - the collapse of the Soviet Union, the internal unrest, and the growing anticipation of a post-Castro Cuba.</p><p>Georgie Anne Geyer has reported on political events around the world for the past three decades. She is the author of numerous books including &#34;Guerilla Prince: The Untold Story of Fidel Castro,&#34; She holds twenty-one honorary degrees from various colleges and universities and is syndicated in nearly 120 newspapers.Geyer, a syndicated journalist long familiar with Latin America and intrigued by Castro, has crafted a major biography of this enigmatic and fascinating figure. Her work differs from Ted Szulc's Fidel: A Critical Portrait ( LJ 1/15/87) in that it focuses on Castro's personality, on his personal rather than policy motivations, and offers a detailed psychological portrait. Geyer used some 900 interviews obtained over many years to document Castro's brutal treatment of thousands of Cubans and his fanatic hatred of the United States. The reader is left with a persuasive picture of a paranoid, erratic megalomaniac, whose personal life is a microcosm of his public behavior. Highly recommended.<br><i>- Roderic A.

By the author of The Towers of the Sunset.</p><p>L. E. Modesitt, Jr., is the bestselling author of over forty novels, including the Imager Portfolio series and the Saga of Recluce series, as well as several other novels in the science fiction genre. He has also published technical studies and articles, columns, poetry, and a number of science fiction stories.There is little to distinguish this newest Recluce work (after Towers of the Sunset ) from its myriad fantasy brethren. This time around, Modessit's world of Order (Black) and Chaos (White) features the plodding Dorrin, a healer/engineer who dreams of making machines and often denies what other people consider his extraordinary abilities. When the White Wizards of Chaos threaten the area of the world to which the Order-based Dorrin has been exiled to "find himself," he uses his engineering talents to design and build weaponry and his dreamed-of machines. Modesitt's prose lacks the range to make his rather pedestrian narrative interesting: more than a few events are unnecessarily telegraphed to readers several chapters before they happen, and the same character often--irritatingly--described three different ways within a few paragraphs. The most effective moments are those depicting the troubled relationship between Dorrin and a woman named Liedral.

A lifelong resident of New York City, she currently lives in Brooklyn, New York.Grade 7-9-Timothy Hunter's mother has died, and his grieving father has become distant. One day, four men in trench coats approach the 13-year-old and ask him if he believes in magic. It turns out that Timothy has the potential to be the greatest magician who ever lived. From there, the plot, or what plot there is to speak of, involves Timothy's introduction to the world of magic, and the decision he must make as to whether to follow this path or to remain a normal kid. The trench-coat brigade leads him on a whirlwind tour from London to San Francisco to the realm of Faerie. This book reads like a very extended prologue to the real story, and the comparisons to "Harry Potter" are obvious. Timothy even wears glasses. An introduction by Neil Gaiman, who wrote the graphic novels upon which this book is based, sets the stage with the background to the story. Jablonski's writing is of the movie novelization variety, perhaps reflecting the comic-book roots of the story.

Originally composed and performed between 1798 and 1826, they have inspired artists of all kinds&#x2014;not only musicians&#x2014;and have been subject to endless reinterpretation. But what is it like to personally take up the challenge of these compositions, not only as a musician, but as a member of a quartet, where each player has ideas about style and expression? To answer this question, Edward Dusinberre, first violinist of the renowned Tak�cs Quartet, offers a rare peek inside the workings of his ensemble, while providing an insightful history of the compositions and their performance.<br><br> Founded in Hungary in 1975 and now based in Boulder, Colorado, the Tak�cs is one of the world&#x2019;s preeminent string quartets, and performances of Beethoven have been at the center of their work together for over forty years. Using the history of both the Tak�cs Quartet and the Beethoven quartets as a foundation, <i>Beethoven for a Later Age&nbsp;</i>provides a backstage look at the daily life of a quartet, showing the necessary creative tension between individual and group and how four people can at the same time forge a lasting artistic connection and enjoy making music together over decades. The key, Dusinberre reveals, to a quartet crafting its own sound is in balancing continuity with change and experimentation&#x2014;a theme that lies at the heart of Beethoven&#x2019;s remarkable compositions. In an accessible style, suitable for novices and chamber music enthusiasts alike, Dusinberre illuminates the variety and contradictions of Beethoven's quartets, which were composed against the turbulent backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars and their aftermath, and he brings the technical aspects of the music to life.<br><br><i>Beethoven for a Later Age</i> vividly shows that creative engagement with Beethoven&#x2019;s radical and brilliant quartets continues to be as stimulating now as it was for its first performers and audiences. Musicians and music lovers will be intrigued by Dusinberre&#x2019;s exploration of the close collaboration at the heart of any great performance.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Edward Dusinberre</b> has been the first violinist of Tak�cs Quartet since 1993, and he is an artist-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder.&#x201c;A richly detailed portrayal of the intimate workings of a great string quartet, in this case the magical Tak�cs, as revealed to us through the recollections of its first violinist. &nbsp;Fascinating certainly to someone working in another artistic realm entirely.&#x201d; &nbsp; (Philip Roth)<br><br>&#x201c;Dusinberre brilliantly spans Beethoven&#x2019;s life, works, and the real issues of music making for his contemporaries into our time&#x2014;via the working process of a great modern quartet living with Beethoven's creations in the twenty-first century. We are given intimate insight into the almost impossible-to-describe musical process of rehearsal and performance, the artistic and human interaction that links these modern musicians with their forebears and Beethoven himself. I&#x2019;m struck by Dusinberre&#x2019;s ability to take us inside the mind and spirit of a performer and struck by his understanding of Beethoven&#x2019;s music and time.&nbsp; He brings us with him into our own epoch, and we note the remarkable parallels.&#x201d; (Garrick Ohlsson, pianist)<br><br>&#x201c;This singular memoir looks both into the mind of a string quartet player and into the collective mind of his ensemble. It&#x2019;s a portrait not of science but of art: fluid, evolving, obsessed with the disciplined, elusive, ultimately impossible quest for something definitive, at the same time subject to the inspirations of the moment and the presence of the cougher in the second row. The book will be something between informative and revelatory to readers from musicians to music lovers.&#x201d; (Jan Swafford, author of Beethoven: Anguish and Triumph)<br><br>&#x201c;In this brief but&nbsp;beguiling&nbsp;book, Dusinberre . . . takes us inside the complexity of [Beethoven&#x2019;s] masterpieces&#x2014;elucidating the history of their creation and explaining, with the minimum of technicality, the challenges they pose to performers and audience. . . . The glimpse Dusinberre gives us of their working is&nbsp;fascinating.&#x201d; (<i>Telegraph</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book follows [Dusinberre&#x2019;s] personal journey, while simultaneously threading through the parallel stories of Beethoven&#x2019;s development as a composer, of the string quartet in general, and of early 19th-century culture and politics. Does all that seem a tall order? The narrative is potentially as complex as one of Beethoven&#x2019;s knotty four-part fugues in the late quartets, but 20 years&#x2019; experience of playing chamber music has made Dusinberre adept at handling the interplay of multiple themes. Self-awareness and a sense of humour play their part. Sleight of hand makes the book entertaining and easy to digest.&#x201d; (<i>Financial Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Full of insights. . . . Dusinberre&#x2019;s concluding musical commentary moulds past and present into a powerful and thought-provoking whole.&#x201d; (<i>Independent</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Dusinberre is the lead violinist of the Takacs Quartet, one of the world&#x2019;s most highly regarded string ensembles, and he has written a fascinating book about the musical life of this group of players. Interwoven with that is the story of Beethoven&#x2019;s 16 string quartets, works of extraordinary power written over a quarter-century that moved the genre on from the earlier masters and are now regarded as the apogee of the chamber-music repertoire.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Economist</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In the course of&nbsp;Dusinberre&#x2019;s&nbsp;wonderful,&nbsp;engaging, and intimate&nbsp;book,&nbsp;the eager listener (even&nbsp;one&nbsp;like me,&nbsp;with&nbsp;no technical&nbsp;knowledge of music)&nbsp;is initiated into the&nbsp;mysteries&nbsp;of composing and playing some of the greatest music ever&nbsp;heard. The music, as a result,&nbsp;seems even greater&#x2014;and more mysterious than ever.&#x201d; (<i>Geoff Dyer, author of But Beautiful</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Gathering up and reflecting on the work of his predecessors is not the least of Edward Dusinberre&#x2019;s achievements in a book unlike any other in its field, to be considered and enjoyed by anyone with more than a passing interest in Beethoven or quartet playing.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Gramophone</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;At the heart of the book is Dusinberre&#x2019;s and the quartet&#x2019;s internal challenge of bringing to life the music of Beethoven for modern ears. For those who have ever wondered what goes on behind the closed doors of a rehearsal, the book pulls back the veil and reveals some of the variables at play, including the very real presence of the composer, long dead, whose notes are on the page. What Dusinberre does best, though, is use the deeply emotional and personal music of Beethoven in a thoughtful juxtaposition with the progression of his own individual experiences as part of the notable string quartet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Summit Daily</i>)</p><h2>Crown Molding &amp; Trim Install It Like A Pro</h2><p>This unique book (printed in full color) contains all the information needed to cut and install crown molding and trim.

The Gears live in Thermopolis, WY.</p>The Dawn Country<br>OneNightfall had silenced the mountains. No owls hooted; no trees snapped in the cold wind that swayed the branches. There was only the faint roar of the fire in the distance.Sonon pulled his black cape more tightly around him and studied the frozen ground. The warriors' feet had hewn a dark swath through the frost that glittered in the gaudy orange halo. His gaze followed their trail to the burning village. The Dawnland People had called it Bog Willow Village. Yesterday it had contained over one hundred houses.He hadn't expected the village to be this bad.As he walked toward it, ash fell around him like fine flakes of obsidian, coating his cape and long hair, turning them gray. The forty-hand-tall palisade that surrounded the village had burned through in too many places. That had been their doom. They must have watched in horror as the enemy streamed through those gaps and raced across the village, killing everything in their path.He turned back around to stare at the victory camp. Hundreds of celebrating warriors danced to the sound of drums and flutes. Most were from the Flint or Mountain Peoples, but the war party had contained a few Hills People warriors, too. He knew them from their distinctive tattoos, and the designs painted on their bows and capes.On the far side of the camp, near the river, captive women and children huddled together, shivering, watching their captors with wide stunned eyes. Before dawn came all would be sold and marched away to enemy villages. The lucky ones would be adopted into families and spend the rest of their lives trying to forget this night. The others wouldn't have to worry about it.Sonon took a breath and let it out slowly.There were still times when he woke to the sound of screams that existed only inside him. For many summers he'd thought they were the cries of his twin sister, and he'd been ravaged by guilt. When he'd finally realized the voice was his own, the pain had eased a little. The day they were sold into slavery, he'd seen only eight summers. He wasn't a warrior. There was nothing he could have done to save her--or himself.He clenched his fists so hard his nails bit into his palms. He had to go down there, into the village. No man wished to admit he was afraid, but ...He forced his legs to walk. At first, only a few bodies lay alongside the trail, but as he neared the palisade the number increased. Desperate villagers must have fought to get outside and run headlong into a line of waiting archers. Bodies, bristling with arrows, had piled up around each gap in the defensive wall. The last few to make it outside probably had to shove their way through a mound of dead.Sonon carefully stepped around the carnage and ducked through the charred hole in the palisade. The heat struck him first. He threw up an arm and squinted against the glare to see what remained of Bog Willow Village. In less than twenty heartbeats he was sweating, struggling for air. The smoke was so thick it was almost impossible to breathe.Five paces away an old woman sat on the ground with her face in her hands, rocking back and forth in dazed silence. A few other survivors stumbled past. They moved methodically, searching for loved ones or bending to collect precious belongings: a dropped pot or basket, children's toys.<i>I'm over here. See me?</i>Sonon stopped, and tiny tornadoes of ash spun away from his sandals. They whirled through the firelit shadows. Was it just his fatigue? It sounded like a boy's voice.Cautiously, he veered around a collapsed wall and began searching the debris. Twenty paces later, he almost stumbled over the child.Two small arms extended from beneath a buckled wall.Sonon knelt and pulled the boy from the heap of smoldering bark. Most of his hair had been singed off. He'd seen perhaps six or seven summers. For a time, he just held the boy in his lap and listened to the crackling roar of the fire. Somewhere in the conflagration, muted voices shouted names ... and went unanswered. Occasionally, orphaned children darted by.When he could, he staggered to his feet and carried the boy between the burning husks of two houses, then stepped through a gap in the palisade wall and trudged down to the river's edge, where he gently rested the boy on the shore. In the wavering glare, the boy's half-open eyes seemed to be alive and watching him.<i>Why do I only hear them when the struggle is over? Are the voices of the dead only audible to those trapped in eternal night?</i>Sonon tenderly adjusted the boy's cape, pulling it up around his throat to keep him warm. "It's all right," he said. "I'll make sure they find you. Your clan will take care of you, and you'll have no trouble crossing the bridge to the afterlife. Your ancestors will be waiting for you."Though he was a man of the Hills nation, he knew the ways of the Dawnland People. They believed that the unburied dead became Ghost Fires, angry fire-beings that could not cross the bridge to the afterlife and were forever doomed to remain around the deteriorating bones. The Bog Willow Village survivors would not leave their beloved relatives to that terrible fate, not if they could help it. That meant someone would come looking for this child. His body would be ritually cleaned and prepared for the long journey; then his family would sing him to the afterlife. Having the boy out here in the open would make it easier for his relatives to find him.Sonon wiped his soot-coated face with the back of his hand and looked out across the river to the opposite, willow-choked bank. Beyond it, towering black spruces caught the reflections in the water and seemed made of translucent amber wings. The river itself, coated with ash, had an opaque leaden sheen.He stood up and turned back to the village. For ten heartbeats, he just breathed and studied the palisade. People from distant places did not understand that each log was a Standing Warrior. Among their peoples, the angry souls of dead warriors were excluded from the Land of the Dead, so they moved into trees. They remained in the wood for centuries, until the tree disintegrated and their souls were forced toseek new homes. It was these trees that the People cut down to make their palisades. That meant that every log was a warrior still keeping guard, still protecting his or her people.He wondered what the Standing Warriors must be feeling. Not so long ago, they'd watched this little boy racing happily across the plaza, seen him playing ball and dish games with his friends, heard his laughter ringing through the village on quiet summer afternoons. Their grief must be unbearable.Sonon whispered, "No one could have held off such an assault. It wasn't your fault. You did the best you--"Voices drifted from the river. He turned.A birch-bark canoe quietly slipped through the smoke, parting the river like an arrow, heading south. An old woman rode in the bow. She was dressed like a man and wore a long black wig, but a few greasy twists of gray hair stuck out around the edges, framing her deeply wrinkled face. Even if she hadn't been in disguise, he would have known her. A thousand summers from now, as he walked the earth alone, he would hear her footsteps in his nightmares.Four children lay together in her canoe, crying. Three warriors with paddles swiftly drove them forward. Close on the heels of the first, another canoe pierced the darkness--with three more captive children.As the canoes passed, waves rippled outward and washed up on the shore near the dead boy, leaving delicate ribbons of firelit foam at his feet.Everything about tonight felt strange and surreal. As though Sonon was locked in a trance and could not wake, his heart thumped a dull staccato against his chest.At least a few of the children had escaped. Earlier in the evening, he'd helped them ... as much as he could.When the canoes vanished into the darkness, he looked at the western mountains. He couldn't see the pass through the smoke and falling ash. The trail the escaped children had taken was the fastest way back to the lands of the People of the Standing Stone. But there would be many others on that trail: survivors of the village slaughter, orphaned children, and a few wary men who'd left the victory camp early, trying to beat the onslaught of warriors who would crowd the trail just after dawn.Very softly he called, "Stay strong, Odion, and you'll be all right. You'll--"<i>I'm here. Right here. Please find me?</i>Sonon squeezed his eyes closed for several long moments. It was a girl's voice.He clenched his fists again; then he tramped back up the hill, ducked through the gap in the palisade, and trotted into the roaring inferno to search for her.Copyright � 2011 by Kathleen O'Neal Gear and W.

The statistics are staggering. Twelve million people were displaced; a million died; seventy-five thousand women are said to have been abducted and raped; families were divided; properties lost; homes destroyed. In public memory, however, the violent, disturbing realities that accompanied Partition have remained blanketed in silence. And yet, in private, the voices of Partition have never been stilled and its ramifications have not yet ended.</p><p>&#x201c;This is a magnificent and necessary book, rigorous and compassionate, thought-provoking and moving. Oral history at its best.&#x201d;&#x2014;Salman Rushdie <p>&#x201c;The Other Side of Silence is without a doubt one of the most important books ever to be written about the Partition of the Indian subcontinent. More than a history, more than a memoir, it is also an extended reflection on narrative form. Official history has always flinched from acknowledging the full extent of the human cost of Partition. Urvashi Butalia shows us why we cannot afford to forget the suffering, the grief, the pain, and the bewilderment that resulted from the division of the subcontinent.

After attending the Dragon School and Shrewsbury School, he studied Engineering Science at Balliol College, Oxford. He worked as an aeronautical engineer and published his first novel, <i>Marazan</i>, in 1926. In 1931 he married Frances Mary Heaton and they went on to have two daughters. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he worked on developing secret weapons.

The accounts are short, and unimaginably tragic, many accompanied by the author&#39;s photos. Proceeds from sale of the book go to a fund for hospitals in Vietnam. Annotation copyright Book News, Inc. Portland, Or.</p><p>"In the United States," writes the author of this deeply disturbing book, "while public attention has focused on the American soldier as a victim of 'misguided' policy, there seems to be little concern or even curiosity about the people of that faraway land who were the object of our country's apocalyptic wrath." Hess traveled the length and breadth of Vietnam in 1990 and 1991, listening to the recollections of men and women who lost family, limbs or sanity--sometimes all of these--during the 1965-1973 war; who witnessed the bombing of schools, hospitals, churches, temples, ferryboats, and animals; who survived beatings, rape and torture, and saw the mass slaughter of civilians by U.S. ground troops. It is difficult to imagine a more powerful indictment of American military conduct in Vietnam than these testimonies (supplemented with photos of many of the speakers) by people who suffered irreparable damage from American weapons and toxic chemicals. One of the victims remarks, "The Americans cannot repay the debt, because it is too big."

Sophie never understood why her tutorial partner Holly left Oxford so abruptly. What would she think, if she knew the truth?</p><p>Sarah Vaughan read English at Oxford and went on to become a journalist. She spent eleven years at the <i>Guardian</i> as a news reporter, health correspondent, and political correspondent. She left to freelance and began writing fiction the week she turned forty. Her debut novel, <i>The Art of Baking Blind</i>, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton, St. Martin&#x2019;s Press, and in seven other languages, was the result. <i>The Farm at the Edge of the World</i> was published in June 2016 and will be published in Germany and France. Sarah lives in Cambridge with her husband and two children.Sophie has never thought of her husband as a liar.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She knows he dissembles, yes. That&#x2019;s part of his job&#x2014;a will�ingness to be economical with the truth. A prerequisite, even for a government minister.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But she has never imagined he would lie to her. Or rather, that he might have a life she knows nothing about: a secret that could detonate beneath her lovingly maintained world and blow it apart forever.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Watching him that Friday, as he leaves to take the children to school, she feels a stab of love so fierce she pauses on the stairs just to drink in the tableau of the three of them together. They are framed in the doorway, James turning to call good�bye, left arm raised in that politician&#x2019;s wave she used to mock but which now seems second nature, right hand cradling Finn&#x2019;s head. Their son&#x2014;fringe falling in his eyes, socks bagging round his ankles&#x2014;scuffs at the tiles, reluctant, as ever, to go. His elder sister, Emily, ducks through the doorway: age nine, determined not to be late.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, bye, then,&#x201d; her husband calls, and the autumn sun catches the top of his still-boyish crop, illuminating him with a halo, highlighting his six-foot-three frame.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Bye, Mum,&#x201d; her daughter shouts, as she runs down the steps.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Bye, Mummy.&#x201d; Finn, thrown by the change to his routine&#x2014; his father taking them to school for once&#x2014;juts out his bottom lip and flushes red.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on, little man.&#x201d; James steers him through the door: competent, authoritative even, and she almost resents the fact that she still finds this attractive, commanding. Then he smiles down at his boy and his entire face softens. Finn is his weak spot. &#x201c;You know you&#x2019;ll enjoy it when you get there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slips his arm over his son&#x2019;s shoulders and guides him down their neat, West London garden, with its sculpted bay trees standing like sentinels and its path fringed with lavender, away from her and out down the street.<br><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My family</i>, she thinks, watching the perfect-looking trio go&#x2014;her girl racing ahead to embrace the day, all skinny legs and swishing ponytail, her boy slipping his hand into his father&#x2019;s and looking up at him with that unashamed adoration that comes with being six. The similarity between man and boy&#x2014;for Finn is a miniaturized version of his father&#x2014;only magnifies her love. <i>I have a beautiful boy and a beautiful man</i>, she thinks, as she watches James&#x2019;s broad shoulders&#x2014;a one-time rower&#x2019;s shoulders&#x2014;and waits, more in hope than expectation, for him to look back and smile at her, for she has never managed to grow immune to his charisma.<br><br> Of course he doesn&#x2019;t and she watches as they slip out of sight. The most precious people in her world.<br><br> That world crumbles at 8:43 p.m. James is late. She should have known he would be. It is an alternate Friday: one in which he is holding a constituency meeting, deep in the Surrey countryside, in a brightly lit village hall.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When he had first been elected, they had stayed there every weekend: decamping to a cold, damp cottage that had never quite felt like home, despite their extensive renovations. One election on, and it was a relief to give up the pretense that Thurlsdon was where they wanted to spend half their week. Lovely in the sum�mer months, yes, but bleak in winter, when she would stare out at the bare trees fringing their hamlet garden and try to placate their urban children, who wanted the bustle and distraction of their real, North Kensington home.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They venture there once a month now, and James schleps down for a meeting in the intervening fortnight. Two hours on a Friday afternoon; he promised to leave by six.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He has a driver now that he is junior minister and should have been back by seven thirty&#x2014;traffic permitting. They are sup�posed to be going to friends&#x2019; for a kitchen supper. Well, she says <i>friends</i>. Matt Frisk is another junior minister&#x2014;aggressively ambitious in a way that doesn&#x2019;t sit well with their set, where success is understood as inevitable but naked ambition considered vulgar.<br><br> But he and Ellie are near neighbors and she couldn&#x2019;t easily put them off again.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie had said they would be there by eight fifteen. It was ten past now, so where was he? The October evening crept against the sash windows: black softened by the glow of the street lamps, autumn stealing in. She loves this time of year. It reminds her of fresh starts, running through the leaves in Christ Church Meadows as a fresher, giddy at the thought of new worlds opening up to her. Since having children, it has been a time to nest; to cosset with log fires, roast chestnuts, take brisk, crisp walks, and make game casseroles. But now, the autumn night was taut with apprehension. Footsteps tottered down the pavement and a woman&#x2019;s laugh rang out, flirtatious. A deeper voice murmured. Not James&#x2019;s. The footsteps rose and fell, died away.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pressed redial. His mobile rang then clicked to voicemail. She jabbed the sleek face of her phone&#x2014;rattled at her loss of cus�tomary self-control. Dread tightened her stomach and for a mo�ment she was back in the chill lodge of her Oxford college, the wind whistling through the quad, as she waited for the pay phone to ring. The look of sympathy from a college porter. The chill fear&#x2014;so intense in that last week of her first summer term&#x2014;that something still more terrible was about to happen. Age nineteen and willing him to call, even then.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eight fourteen. She tried again, hating herself for doing it. His phone clicked straight through to voicemail. She plucked at a piece of imaginary lint, rearranged her friendship bracelets, and glanced critically at her nails&#x2014;neatly filed, unvarnished, unlike Ellie&#x2019;s gleaming gelled slicks.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Footsteps on the stairs. A child&#x2019;s voice. &#x201c;Is Daddy back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, go back to bed.&#x201d; Her tone came out harsher than she intended.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Emily stared, one eyebrow raised.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Just climb back into bed, sweetheart,&#x201d; she added, her voice softening as she chased her daughter up the stairs, heart quicken�ing as she turned the corner and bundled her under the covers. &#x201c;You should be settling down, now. He won&#x2019;t be long.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can he come and say goodnight when he gets in?&#x201d; Emily pouted, impossibly pretty.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re going out, but if you&#x2019;re still awake . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I will be.&#x201d; Her daughter&#x2019;s determination&#x2014;the set of her jaw, the implacable self-belief&#x2014;marked her out as her father&#x2019;s daugh�ter.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;ll come up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie gave her a quick peck on the forehead, to curb further arguments, and tucked the duvet around her. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you out of bed again, though. Understand? Cristina&#x2019;s babysitting just like normal. I&#x2019;ll send Daddy up when he gets back.&#x201d;<br><br> Eight seventeen. She forced herself not to ring his number. She has never been the sort of wife who behaves like a stalker, but there was something about this complete silence that chilled her. It just wasn&#x2019;t like him. She imagined him stuck on the M25, working his way through his papers in the back of his car. He would call, text, send an email, not leave her waiting&#x2014;the au pair hanging around the kitchen, keen for them to disap�pear so that she can curl up on the sofa and have the house to herself; Sophie&#x2019;s carefully touched-up face becoming a little less perfect; the flowers bought for the Frisks wilting in their wrap�ping on the table in the hall.<br><br> Eight twenty-one. She would call the Frisks at half past. But that deadline came and still she didn&#x2019;t ring. Eight thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven. Aware that it was bad form to do so, at eight forty she sent Ellie Frisk a brief, apologetic text explain�ing that something had cropped up in the constituency and they were terribly sorry but they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to make it, after all.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The <i>Times</i> had a piece on the Islamic State by Will Stanhope but the words of her old college contemporary washed over her. It might as well be a story about dinosaur astronauts, read to Finn, to the extent to which it engaged her. Every part of her was attuned to one thing.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And there it is. The sound of his key in the door. A scrape and then a hiss as the heavy oak eases open. The sound of his footsteps: slower than normal, not his usual brisk, assertive tread. Then the thud of his red box being put down, the weight of responsibility abandoned for a while&#x2014;as glorious a sound, on a Friday night, as the slosh of dry white wine being poured from a bottle. The jangle of keys on the hall table. And then silence again.<br><br> &#x201c;James?&#x201d; She comes into the hall.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His beautiful face is grey, his smile taut and not reaching his eyes, where his light crow&#x2019;s feet seemed deeper than usual.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;d better cancel the Frisks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I have done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shrugs off his coat and hangs it up carefully, averting his face.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pauses then slips her arms around his waist&#x2014;his honed waist that deepens to form a V, like the trunk of a sapling that burgeons outwards&#x2014;but he reaches back and gently eases them away.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;James?&#x201d; The cold in the pit of her stomach flares.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is Cristina here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, send her to her room, will you? We need to talk in private.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; Her heart flutters as she hears her voice come out clipped.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gives her another tight smile, and a note of impatience creeps into his voice, as if she is a disobliging child, or perhaps, a tardy civil servant. &#x201c;Can you do it now, please, Sophie?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stares back at him, not recognizing his mood&#x2014;so differ�ent to what she had expected.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He massages his forehead with firm, long fingers, and his green eyes close briefly, the lashes&#x2014;disarmingly long&#x2014;kissing his cheeks. Then, his eyes flash open, and the look he gives her is the one Finn gives when he is trying to preempt a telling off and plead forgiveness. It&#x2019;s the look James gave her twenty-three years ago be�fore confessing to the crisis that had threatened to overwhelm him, that had caused them to split up, that still sometimes causes her to shiver, and that she fears is about to rear its head again.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Soph. So sorry.&#x201d; And it is as if he is carrying not just the weight of his job&#x2014;undersecretary of state for countering extremism&#x2014;but responsibility for the entire government.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve fucked up big time.&#x201d;<br><br> Her name was Olivia Lytton&#x2014;though Sophie had always just thought of her as James&#x2019;s parliamentary researcher&#x2014;five foot ten, twenty-eight, blonde, well connected, confident, ambitious.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I expect she&#x2019;ll be dubbed the blonde bombshell.&#x201d; She tries for acerbic, but her voice just comes out as shrill.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The affair had been going on for five months, and he had broken it off a week ago, just after the party conference.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It meant nothing,&#x201d; James says, head in hands, no pretense that he is anything other than penitent. He leans back, wrinkling his nose as he trots out another clich�. &#x201c;It was just sex, and I was flattered.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She swallows, rage pushing against her chest, barely contain-able. &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s OK then.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His eyes darken as he takes in her pain.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There was nothing wrong with that part of us. You know that.&#x201d; He can usually read her so clearly: a skill honed over two decades, one of the things that binds them so closely. &#x201c;I just made a foolish mistake.&#x201d;<br><br> She waits, poised on the sofa opposite, for her anger to subside sufficiently for her to speak civilly, or for him to bridge the distance between them. To reach out a tentative hand, or at least offer a smile.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he is rooted there: head bowed, elbows on knees, fin�gers touching as if in prayer. At first, she despises this show of sanctimony&#x2014;a Blairite trope, the penitent politician&#x2014;and then she softens as his shoulders shake, just the once, not with a sob but with a sigh. For a moment, she sees her mother as her charm�ing, rakish father confessed to yet another &#x201c;indiscretion.&#x201d; Ginny&#x2019;s dry resignation, and then the quickly suppressed flash of pain in her marine-blue eyes.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps this is what all husbands do? Sorrow surges, then anger. It shouldn&#x2019;t be like this. Their marriage is different. Founded on love and trust and a sex life that she does her very best to maintain.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She has made compromises in her life, and God knows, she took a huge leap of faith when they got back together. But the one certainty was that their relationship is solid. Her vision be�gins to blur, her gaze filming with tears. He looks up and catches her eye&#x2014;and she wishes he hadn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;There&#x2019;s something else,&#x201d; he says.<br><br> Of <i>course </i>he wouldn&#x2019;t confess to an affair without a reason.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Is she pregnant?&#x201d; The words&#x2014;ugly but necessary&#x2014;discolor the space between them.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, of course not.&#x201d;<br><br> She feels herself relax a little. No half-sibling for Emily and Finn. No proof of a liaison. No need to share him in any other way.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then he looks up with a grimace. Her nails bite into her palm in sharp crescents, and she sees that her knuckles are ivory pearls thrusting through the red of her skin.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What could be worse than some other woman having his child, or perhaps choosing to abort his child? Other people knowing. The affair, a particularly juicy piece of gossip, dropped into the ear of a favored few in the Commons tea rooms until it becomes general knowledge. Who knows? His colleagues? The PM? Other MPs&#x2019; wives? What about Ellie? She imagines Ellie&#x2019;s silly, plump face alight with barely suppressed pity. Perhaps she already knows and recognized her lie of a text.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sophie forces herself to breathe deeply. They can deal with this; move beyond it. They have experienced far worse, haven&#x2019;t they? There is no crime in having a quick fling. It can be brushed over, quickly forgotten, absorbed. And then James says something that takes this to a more damaging, corrosive level that strikes her in the solar plexus hard as she contemplates a scenario so terrible that, fool that she is, she hadn&#x2019;t quite seen coming.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;The story&#x2019;s about to break.&#x201d;</p><h2>Socktopus: 17 Pairs of Socks Worth Showing Off</h2><p>Sock knitters now have something to really get their needles into with this inspirational book packed with invaluable tips and 17 fabulous projects.

How can we become tried and true "warriors in spirit" to win the battle for our own souls? And how can we help those around us who are surrendering hope, giving up on God, and falling? Andrew Murray was deeply engaged in this warfare for the lives and souls of men and discovered a source of spiritual power greater than all the darkness rising against him.</p><p>Andrew Murray (1828-1917) accepted the challenge to take the light of Christ to an area of Africa known for its "wild dogs and wilder men." In the midst of personal weakness and physically grueling work, he was soon attacked by liberal church leaders who wanted to stop the true life of the Spirit from spreading. In the center of this opposition, Andrew discovered the new "fire" from heaven that ignited dark hearts and destroyed spiritual strongholds. The spiritual strength can be ours today as we surrender ourselves to be swords of power in the hand of God.</p></p><p><b>David Hazard</b> is an editor/writer with vast experience in the Christian book world.

When she moved with her family to Scots Bay, Nova Scotia, she learned that their new home was once known as the birth house.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i><b>Prologue</b><br><br>My house stands at the edge of the earth. Together, the house and I have held strong against the churning tides of Fundy. Two sisters, stubborn in our bones.<br><br>My father, Judah Rare, built this farmhouse in 1917. It was my wedding gift. <i>A strong house for a Rare woman</i>, he said. I was eighteen. He and his five brothers, shipbuilders by trade, raised her worthy from timbers born on my grand�father&#x2019;s land. Oak for stability and certainty, yellow birch for new life and change, spruce for protection from the world outside. Father was an intuitive carpenter, carrying out his work like holy ritual. His callused hands, veined with pride, had a memory for measure and a knowing of what it takes to withstand the sea.<br><br>Strength and a sense of knowing, that&#x2019;s what you have to have to live in the Bay. Each morning you set your sights on the tasks ahead and hope that when the day is done you&#x2019;re farther along than when you started. Our little village, perched on the crook of God&#x2019;s finger, has always been ruled by storm and season. The men did whatever they had to do to get by. They joked with one another in fire-warmed kitchens after sunset, smoking their pipes, someone bringing out a fiddle . . . laughing as they chorused, <i>no matter how rough, we can take it</i>. The seasons were reflected in their faces, and in the movement of their bodies. When it was time for the shad, herring and cod to come in, they were fishermen, dark with tiresome wet from the sea. When the deer began to huddle on the back of the mountain, they became hunters and woodsmen. When spring came, they worked the green-scented earth, planting crops that would keep, potatoes, cabbage, carrots, turnips. Summer saw their weathered hands building ships and haying fields, and sunsets that ribboned over the water, daring the skies to turn night. The long days were filled with pride and ceremony as mighty sailing ships were launched from the shore. <i>The Lauretta, The Reward, The Nordica, The Bluebird, The Huntley</i>. My father said he&#x2019;d scour two hundred acres of forest just to find the perfect trees to build a three-masted schooner. Tall yellow birch, gently arched by northwesterly winds, was highly prized. He could spot the keel in a tree&#x2019;s curve and shadow, the return of the tide set in the grain.<br><br>Men wagered their lives with the sea for the honour of these vessels. Each morning they watched for the signs. <i>Red skies in morning, sailors take warning</i>. Each night they looked to the heavens, spotting starry creatures, or the point of a dragon&#x2019;s tail. They told themselves that these were promises from God, that He would keep the wiry cold fingers of the sea from grabbing at them, from taking their lives. Sometimes men were taken. On those dark days the men who were left behind sat down together and made conversation of every detail, hitching truth to wives&#x2019; tales while mending their nets.<br><br>As the men bargained with the elements, the women tended to matters at home. They bartered with each other to fill their pantries and clothe their children. Grandmothers, aunts and sisters taught one another to stitch and cook and spin. On Sunday mornings mothers bent their knees between the stalwart pews at the Union Church, praying they would have enough. With hymnals clutched against their breasts, they told the Lord they would be ever faithful if their husbands were spared.<br><br>When husbands, fathers and sons were kept out in the fog longer than was safe, the women stood at their windows, holding their lamps, a chorus of lady moons beckoning their lovers back to shore. Waiting, they hushed their children to sleep and listened for the voice of the moon in the crashing waves. In the secret of the night, mothers whispered to their daughters that only the moon could force the waters to submit. It was the moon&#x2019;s voice that called the men home, her voice that turned the tides of womanhood, her voice that pulled their babies into the light of birth.<br><br>My house became the birth house. That&#x2019;s what the women came to call it, knocking on the door, ripe with child, water breaking on the porch. First-time mothers full of questions, young girls in trouble and seasoned women with a brood already at home.

In award-winning books such as <i>1812: The War Nobody Won</i>, <i>Cowboys, Indians, and Gunfighters: The Story of the Cattle Kingdom</i>, and <i>"Unconditional Surrender": U. S. Grant and the Civil War</i>, he has created a tapestry of United States history by focusing on dramatic moments and famous personalities. With biographies of leaders and tyrants from Napoleon to Hitler, Marrin has also interpreted the events of a larger world stage for juvenile readers. Additionally, his several books on the First and Second World Wars provide well-organized introductions to many aspects of those struggles. <p> Chairman of the history department at New York's Yeshiva University, Marrin's books for young readers complement his academic duties and writings. One of his earliest such books, <i>Victory in the Pacific</i>, is indicative of Marrin's thorough, no-nonsense approach to history. -Albert Marrin from <i>Authors and Artists for Young Adults</i>. �2005-2006 Thomson Gale, a part of the Thomson Corporation. All rights reserved. </p><p> Dr. Albert Marrin is a master at weaving personal perspective and historical material smoothly to give readers an interesting and reliable account of the subject. He has written over two dozen award-winning nonfiction books for young people which have been called "addictive reading" by <em>The Horn Book</em>. This is a wonderful clue to the type of author Marrin is. We at BFB respect his work and are so pleased to be publishing several of his titles. Three of his books, including <i>Hitler</i> and <i>Stalin: Russia's Man of Steel</i>, were <em>School Library Journal</em> Best Books of the Year.</p>Grade 6-9 Hitler's life is inseparable from Hitler's Germany and Hitler's war, so it is not surprising that, after describing the dictator's childhood and youth in Austria, Marrin turns away from personal biography to describe life in Nazi Germany and then to recount the campaigns of World War II. Throughout the history of events, however, he points to the influence of the dictator, his increasingly irrational drive to consummate his racial policies, and his responsibility for major military decisions. Marrin brings to this biography a wealth of background information. The author is scrupulous in mentioning sources, and he makes liberal use of quotations, statistics, popular sayings, and other factual material. While not a complete biography, the book emphasizes facts that young readers should know about the impact of Hitler's policies on the lives of the German people, the controls exercised over a whole society, and the horrors of the Second World War. In comparison to available literature on this period of history, Marrin's book stands out for its lively writing, its emphasis on personal anecdote, its value as a reference source, and its insight into the nature of totalitarianism. It is an excellent addition to any library.

In this thorough biography, Nadel, a Canadian English professor, tells of Cohen&#39;s childhood in Montreal, his university days in Toronto, his travels to the United States and Greece, and the publishing of his early poetry which earned him a considerable reputation. Cohen&#39;s verse proved translatable into song and his deep voice was melodic enough for him to make it at the folk festivals. His dark lyrics of depression and self-doubt, of searching for meaning in sexual release, of a life suffused with restless intensity, struck a chord with a worldwide audience. Though suicide was a constant theme of his songs, Nadel finishes the book with Cohen finding peace at a Zen monastery in Los Angeles.For nearly forty years, Leonard Cohen has endured the ups and downs of an international career that has alternately identified him as the "Prince of Bummers" and Canada's most respected poet and performer.

Here is a thrilling novel of 1815 London and the incredible characters that made up its world of fashion--and its underworld. &#34;Fast and entertaining reading&#34;.--Chicago Sunday Tribune.</p><p>John Dickson Carr (1906-1977), the master of the locked-room mystery, was born in Uniontown, Pennsylvania, the son of a US Congressman. He studied law in Paris before settling in England where he married an Englishwoman, and he spent most of his writing career living in Great Britain. Widely regarded as one of the greatest Golden Age mystery writers, his work featured apparently impossible crimes often with seemingly supernatural elements. He modelled his affable and eccentric series detective Gideon Fell on G. K. Chesterton, and wrote a number of novels and short stories, including his series featuring Henry Merrivale, under the pseudonym Carter Dickson. He was one of only two Americans admitted to the British Detection club, and was highly praised by other mystery writers. Dorothy L. Sayers said of him that &#39;he can create atmosphere with an adjective, alarm with allusion, or delight with a rollicking absurdity&#39;. In 1950 he was awarded the first of two prestigious Edgar Awards by the Mystery Writers of America, and was presented with their Grand Master Award in 1963. He died in Greenville, South Carolina in 1977.</p><h2>Internal Affairs: A Journal Keeping Workbook for Self-Intimacy</h2><p>Provides practical exercises that focus on crucial aspects of journal writing, teaching users to tap the power of writing for self-reflection and improved self-knowledge</p><p>Journal keeping as a life-transforming tool for listening to oneself, using inner resources, and reaching one&#39;s potential, complete with practical exercises.Regardless of how long it has been since you opened it, your journal need never feel like one more task on your to-do list, but rather a space of welcome, acceptance, and loving attention. Why do we insist on making a chore out of an activity that is healing, nurturing, and accepting? I suspect that most of us are unaccustomed to having a constant healing presence in our lives; it is far more familiar and comfortable to deal with a critical, judgmental voice. In a subtle, profound way, journalkeeping gives us the opportunity to practice loving ourselves. <p> Like the attentiveness of a friend, journalwriting encourages you to listen to yourself, an integral part of intimacy. You sit down, open the journal, pick up the pen, and listen. As you wait for the impulse to write, you may hear a cacophony of voices vying for your attention, or you may hear silence. Each time you write, you affirm and strengthen the skill of inner listening. Journal keeping creates a space in your life to still your external activities so your internal voices can come to consciousness.</p></p><h2>Galveston</h2><p>Galveston and some of its peoples and events from about 1877 to 1920</p><p>Suzanne Morris is a native of Houston.

This is the first book to take a detailed look at the Japanese home island fortifications that were constructed during 1941-45. Utilizing diagrams, specially commissioned artwork, and sources previously unavailable in English, Steven Zaloga examines these defences in the context of a possible Allied invasion, constructing various arguments for one of the greatest &#39;what if&#39; scenarios of World War II, and helping to explain why the Americans decided to go ahead with a nuclear option.</p><p>Steven J.

He lives in Los Angeles.<i>Starred Review.</i> A gallery of grotesques slogs through the sewers of the entertainment industry toward redemption in this exhilarating debut novel from the host of <i>The Late Late Show</i>. Leading the pack are Fraser, a Scottish "phony TV evangelist... drunken, selfish media prick... gossip and sot" who has been disgraced in a sex scandal; his cancer-stricken boyhood pal, George; vapid sit-com star Leon; and Leon's 300-pound, sexually perverted Svengali brother, Saul. They make their separate but linked ways through a world populated by snake handlers, serial killers, dead-eyed whores and hack studio executives pushing formulaic action films, while they take hallucinatory side trips. The sprawling tale, with plenty of Scottish backstory, casts a jaundiced eye on media debaucheries and petty vanities, throwing in miscellaneous riffs on everything from Starbuck's to escort ads, but Ferguson is particularly sharp&#x2014;and funny&#x2014;on Hollywood proper. For every satire of organized religion or a Vegas that's "as glitzy as a trailer park at Christmas," however, he delivers an injunction to "help others" or an ode to Paris in springtime that somehow sounds fresh. The result is a tour de force of cynical humor and poignant reverie, a caustic yet ebullient picaresque that approaches the sacred by way of the profane. <i>(Apr. 10)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This volume documents their travels from the Three Forks of the Missouri River in present-day Montana to the Cascades of the Columbia River on today's Washington-Oregon border, including the expedition's progress over the rugged Bitterroot Mountains, along the nearly impenetrable Lolo Trail. Along the way, the explorers encounter Shoshones, Flatheads, Nez Perces, and other Indian tribes, some of whom had never before met white people.</p></p><p>Gary E. Moulton is Thomas C.

But despite many books about their films and individual lives, there has never been a fully researched, definitive narrative biography of the duo, from birth to death. <br><br>Louvish traces the early lives of Stanley Jefferson and Norvell Hardy and the surrounding minstrel and variety theatre, which influenced all of their later work. Louvish examines the rarely seen solo films of both our heroes, prior to their serendipitous pairing in 1927, in the long-lost short "Duck Soup." The inspired casting teamed them until their last days. Both often married, they found balancing their personal and professional lives a nearly impossible feat. <br><br>Between 1927 and 1938, they were able to successfully bridge the gap between silent and sound films, which tripped up most of their prominent colleagues. Their Hal Roach and MGM films were brilliant, but their move in 1941, to Twentieth Century Fox proved disastrous, with the nine films made there ranking as some of the most embarrassing moments of cinematic history.<br><br>In spite of this, Laurel and Hardy survived as exemplars of lasting genius, and their influence is seen to this day. The clowns were elusive behind their masks, but now Simon Louvish can finally reveal their full and complex humanity, and their passionate devotion to their art. In <i>Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy: The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy</i>, Louvish has seamlessly woven tireless and thorough research into an authoritative biography of these two important and influential Hollywood pioneers. <br></p><p><p>"Thanks to a lively, affectionate writer, we can glimpse the great clowns at work." <br>-<i>The Dallas Morning News</i></p><p>Praise for <i>Stan and Ollie: The Roots of Comedy: The Double Life of Laurel and Hardy</i> </p><p>"[Louvish] has researched his subjects thoroughly. . . .

The term was coined by Bible Belt millenarians who believed the phenomenon&#x2014;a lunar eclipse when the full moon is at its perigee, therefore magnified and pink&#x2014;portended Armageddon. Joel 2:31: &#x201c;The sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the great and dreadful day of the Lord comes.&#x201d; The timing was just good fortune but it turned out I&#x2019;d have among the best views on earth. In my ignorance it was its redness I anticipated as much as its bigness or for that matter the fact that it would be eclipsed, and so when it rose into view, more embers than blood, I was disappointed&#x2014;as disappointed as one can ever be by a new-risen full moon.<br><br>By the time I&#x2019;d rehydrated my noodles and poured my daily half-beaker of wine, the moon had returned from grey-pink to its customary white, like a fingertip pressed against glass, and every cactus and every shrub, and the strawbale cabin, had generated a hard exclusive shadow. It seemed to me that the chief characteristic of night in the desert was not darkness but this light that was not the sun&#x2019;s.<br><br>***<br><br>The cabin stands on a ridge above the San Pedro River sixty kilometres east of Tucson, Arizona. It is a one-room structure about three metres by five, with a door facing north-east. In each of the other three walls is a single window, screened with mesh against insects. It&#x2019;s nice to open the windows to the evening breeze, but during the day they stay shut to keep out the heat. The interior walls are thickly plastered, bumpy and cracked. The floor is packed earth laid with two rugs heavily nibbled by mice. Furniture: a cabinet for cooking utensils, a folding steel cot and mattress, a pine table and matching chairs, and an iron-banded trunk a century old, containing Mexican blankets, batteries and a first-aid kit and dozens of candles. The table resembles an altar. On it, most of the time, stands a storm lantern and a bottle of screw-top Cabernet Merlot ($8.99, Trader Joe&#x2019;s).<br><br>Each of the four windows (there&#x2019;s one in the door) gives onto a hillside thick with mesquite, paloverde, creosote bush, ocotillo, prickly pear, barrel cactus, and saguaro, the region&#x2019;s characteristic cactus, the cactus of cowboy films. It is the saguaros&#x2019; giant candelabra forms that break the line of each hillside and provide landmarks. The tallest for kilometres stands beside the cabin. From the south-west-facing window you can see the Rincon Mountains, with the Little Rincons before them, dropping down to the San Pedro Valley, and the few dwellings of the Cascabel community ten kilometres away. When the sun rises behind me, a blade of light drops from the distant peaks of the Rincons, down the foothills and towards me across the alluvial plain, until slowly, like a lava flow, the threshold where light meets shadow approaches the cabin&#x2014;and then: there! The warmth as the sun&#x2019;s rays touch the back of my head and my shadow is thrown down long before me.<br><br>From a hook fixed to a rafter-end I hang a kettle of water on a bungee each morning, and by 6 p.m. it is hot enough for a shower. On the cabin&#x2019;s opposite side, where there is more shade, lies the two-hundred-litre drum that provides all my water, raised on a bed of rocks and protected against the sun with a jacket of wire-strung saguaro ribs.<br><br>The ridge separates two washes (dry, except after cloudbursts): one is broad and shallow, the other is deep and narrow and what they call an arroyo. The ridge rises to the north-east&#x2014;halfway up this hill, about thirty metres from my door, is a double wooden frame into which two identical square boards are slid, each painted white on one side and on the other red. Every evening, before my shower, though I don&#x2019;t always remember, I walk up the hill along a path marked out with rocks on each side, and slide out the boards, flip them over, and slide them back into the framework. From the ridge near his home down near the San Pedro, my friend Daniel checks each morning with his binoculars, if he remembers; if the boards do not change for a day or two, he&#x2019;ll come and make sure I&#x2019;m okay.<br><br>There are a few books here: a natural history of the Sonoran Desert and a book about the dangerous animals of the region, every one hair-triggered, you&#x2019;d be forgiven for inferring, to sting you, bite you, maul you, or char you with its fiery breath. My own contribution is a paperback facsimile of John C. Van Dyke&#x2019;s 1901 book <i>The Desert</i>. It describes a man&#x2019;s journey, alone, into this desert, the Sonoran, a journey made chiefly in 1898, though its precise course is unclear. He was an accomplished art historian, but trust Van Dyke&#x2019;s guidance at your peril. Here he is, homicidally, on the subject of food and water, for instance: &#x201c;Any athlete or Indian will tell you that you can travel better without them. They are good things at the end of the trip but not at the beginning.&#x201d; Rattlesnakes he describes as &#x201c;sluggish.&#x201d; He shoots grey wolves in California, where there were no wolves, and eulogises the purple flowers of the saguaro, which are white (though the fruits are red). Alerted to certain errors by a well-meaning desert ecologist, he graciously acknowledged the mistakes, promised to correct them in future editions&#x2014;<i>The Desert</i> had a long life&#x2014;and so far as is known made no effort to do so. A note appended to the manuscript of his autobiography spells out his aim: &#x201c;to describe the desert from an aesthetic, not scientific, point of view.&#x201d;<br><br>I no longer sleep inside but, after my sunset shower, drag the cot out to the clearing in front of the door, where I am not disturbed by the lizards in the roof&#x2014;or, more accurately, where the noise they make is subsumed by the larger racket of the desert at night. I lift each of the bed&#x2019;s feet and slip containers of water under them&#x2014;tin mugs, a wooden saucer, a saucepan&#x2014;to keep conenose kissing-bugs or scorpions from joining me. I position the two chairs beside the bed, one at the foot, one alongside my head, and stand lanterns on them. In a row on the ground between them half a dozen candles are stationed. In the mornings the hardened wells around their wicks are black with flying insects. Within this lit perimeter I sleep more easily than I have for months, which is not to say deeply. Waking in the night to the buzzing of cicadas or the yapping of coyotes, I experience a weight of tranquillity that has the quality of a quilt. It might be the peace of the dying.<br><br>Most afternoons, as the warmth first intensifies like an oven preheating, then levels off at a temperature that permits nothing but sitting in the cabin&#x2019;s shadow cowled in a wet scarf, I try to remember how the song goes:<br><br>High on a hill was a lonely goatherd . . .<br>One little girl in a pale pink coat heard . . .<br><br>This is my main afternoon work: to remember the words. And day by day, one by one, they return to me, though it&#x2019;s a year since I last heard the song, coming from a cracked Samsung smartphone on the edge of the Worst Desert on Earth, while to the north a massacre was happening.<br><b>1. The Desert Library</b><br><br>The Empty Quarter, Oman<br><br>It&nbsp;seems a long time ago. The woman I&#x2019;d lived with for four years had taken a job overseas. I would not be going with her. The summer before, in the name of research, I&#x2019;d spent a week with a community of Cistercian monks on the edge of Dartmoor in south-west England. I attended each of the abbey&#x2019;s sacred offices&#x2014;matins at 5:45 a.m., lauds an hour later, Mass at 8 a.m., vespers at 6 p.m., compline at 9&#x2014;and took meals in the vaulted refectory. As the days passed, each office became indistinguishable from the next. I&#x2019;d sit at the high open window of my room, looking out from time to time to follow the swallows as they spiralled over the cloister roof. When the bell tolled, I would put down whatever book I was reading, and go alone down the long stone staircase, three flights, and wait in the chapel for the twelve monks to enter, one by one, and take their places along the walls on either side. I stood at the back and listened to their plainsong.<br><br>It was in the monastery library that I became aware of the connection between Christian monasticism and the desert. I would make a pile of books and carry them up to my small room, and spend the time between offices reading. I learned about the Desert Fathers, the third-and fourth-century solitaries of Upper Egypt, and the first of them, St. Antony. Antony was born in AD 251 in Upper Egypt, the son of a wealthy Christian family. At the age of nineteen, following the deaths of his parents, he happened to pass a church and hear the words of Matthew 19:21: &#x201c;If you would be perfect, go and sell that you have and give to the poor.&#x201d; Antony obeyed and put his younger sister in a nunnery. To give up your possessions, to remove from your life those you love: these are a monk&#x2019;s first acts, but they might also be described as consistent with grieving.<br><br>Artistic depictions of St. Antony&#x2014;&#x201c;the Star of the Desert&#x201d;&#x2014;fall into two categories, each illustrating a central scene in the saint&#x2019;s life: the first shows him in his nineties meeting the dying St. Paul, having walked fifty kilometres from his cave on the other side of Egypt&#x2019;s South Galala Mountains. It is this scene that Vel�zquez&#x2019;s <i>St. Antony Abbot and St. Paul the Hermit </i>depicts: the dying saint, his beard whiter than his companion&#x2019;s, sits on a rocky outcrop, hands fused in prayer, while Antony looks on in awe. Just above their heads a raven descends with a loaf of bread.<br><br>The bird appears in every image of St. Antony and St. Paul, and its presence alone identifies the human figures. The other scenario in which St. Antony is depicted shows an early, more tumultuous period in his life and is much more common on account of its imaginative potency. Having left his home, the young man retired alone to a hut in the desert&#x2014;but it wasn&#x2019;t far, hardly the true desert at all, just a place outside the village walls. There he was besieged by the devil&#x2019;s temptations: memories of his former comforts, his abandoned sister, the promise of money and glory, and above all the &#x201c;spirit of fornication.&#x201d; Hieronymus Bosch&#x2019;s triptych of c. 1500 depicts an army of grotesques crowding its central panel; in the left-hand panel the saint is being rendered away by a squadron of airborne frog-demons; in the right he sits reading, trying to ignore the nude sylph half-concealed in the bole of a dead tree.<br><br>He travels still further into the desert, deeper into the devil&#x2019;s domain, like a military scout preceding an invasion. At Pispir, close to the eastern bank of the Nile, he takes up residence in an abandoned fort. When, in Athanasius&#x2019;s account, his friends visit with bread they hear wrestling and yelling from within: &#x201c;Go from what is ours! What do you even in the desert?&#x201d; But when he emerges, Antony is &#x201c;neither fat, like a man without exercise, nor lean from fasting and striving with demons, but . . . just the same.&#x201d; By now he has become an iconic figure and must fend off acolytes as well as demons. He travels deeper still into the desert, until he reaches the place that would be his home for the rest of his life: the foothills of the South Galala Mountains.<br><br>This story of a step-by-step progression into oblivion, from the lush Nile floodplain to the arid interior, became a model for others wishing to renounce society. According to St. Athanasius, &#x201c;cells filled with holy bands of men who said psalms, loved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of things to come, laboured in almsgiving and preserved love and harmony one with the other.&#x201d; These communities in turn inspired the establishment of Benedictine and Cistercian monasteries in Europe.<br><br>***<br><br>I started accumulating a library of desert travelogues, mostly by nineteenth-and early-twentieth-century travellers. I read them without system or coherence, least of all geographical. I was impelled by a sort of urgency, as if ransacking their pages for the code to deactivate a bomb. Sometimes I&#x2019;d resort to Deuteronomy:<br><br><i>He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness.<br><br></i>T. E. Lawrence&#x2014;Lawrence of Arabia&#x2014;was quoted so ubiquitously that it was barely necessary to own a copy of his first-hand account of the Arab revolt, <i>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</i>. But his fellow Arabists&#x2014;Charles Doughty, Harry St. John Philby, Wilfred Thesiger, and especially Bertram Thomas&#x2014;joined the heap. A single book, one voice alone, was insufficient to hold my attention for long. It was a modern disease. I&#x2019;d wake up in bed or on the sofa, ringed by half a dozen old books, each splayed face-down at the point where I&#x2019;d moved on or nodded off, primed for the next round. As bedfellows went, they were a shabby, irascible, not-always-likeable bunch. Even among the women, the metaphor of sexual conquest was near-ubiquitous: time and again the feminised desert was unveiled, exposed, vanquished and finally penetrated. My bedding was dusty with dried binding-glue.<br><br>It was in this way that I came to think of all these accounts as a single narrative: the deserts of the world as one. It wasn&#x2019;t an unprecedented approach.<br><br>In his translation of <i>The Arabian Nights</i>, I found a footnote by Richard Burton reporting that the &#x201c;Desert Quarter&#x201d; in the original Arabic was given as &#x201c;Rub&#x2019;a al-Khar�b,&#x201d; which he believed alluded to &#x201c;the Rub&#x2019; al-Khali or Great Arabian Desert.&#x201d; In rhetoric, Burton explains, &#x201c;it is opposed to the &#x2018;Rub&#x2019;a Mask�n&#x2019;, or populated fourth of the world, the rest being held to be ocean.&#x201d; Charles Doughty, in the Old Testament prose of his 1888 <i>Travels in Arabia Deserta</i>, writes that, in Arabic lore, &#x201c;two quarters [of the world] divided God to the children of Adam, the third he gave to Ajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog), the fourth part of the world is called Rub&#x2019;a el-Khaly, the Empty Quarter.&#x201d;<br><br>I had to remind myself that &#x201c;the desert&#x201d; was more than a metaphor. For geographers, deserts are simply places where the average annual rainfall is less than 250 millimetres, and where precipitation, by rain or fog or dew, is exceeded by potential evapotranspiration (loss of water through evaporation and the transpiration of plants). The Aridity Index gauges this ratio as P/PET and this formula is used internationally to define the four categories of &#x201c;drylands&#x201d;: Hyper-Arid, Arid, Semi-Arid, and Sub-Humid. Collectively these areas make up more than 40 per cent of the world&#x2019;s surface. The model desert journey is a progression from the sub-humid to the hyper-arid&#x2014;from the Nile to the &#x201c;Inner Mountain,&#x201d; as the South Galala Mountains were known to the Desert Fathers&#x2014;and it was this centripetal tendency that interested me. French travellers in the Sahara in the nineteenth century sought what they called <i>le d�sert absolu</i>. In the <i>Vitae Patrum</i>, the collected sayings and biographies of the Desert Fathers, published in the seventeenth century, we learn of the <i>paneremos </i>(Gr.): at once the place of uttermost lifelessness, and the locus where the desert&#x2019;s identity was most purely asserted, and that point furthest from the periphery. Polar explorers have another term: the Pole of Maximum Inaccessibility. This it seemed was the ultimate objective of every desert traveller: the axis where the absolute coexists with the infinite.</p><h2>Original Sin (Adam Dalgliesh Mystery Series #9)</h2><p>Gerard Etienne, the brilliant new managing director of the Peverell Press, is murdered, and there are many suspects - a discarded mistress, a rejected author and rebellious colleagues.
